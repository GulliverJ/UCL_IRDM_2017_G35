                  ROAST TURKEY WITH CORNBREAD STUFFING
                 Eleanor Sewall, Little Rock, Arkansas

How to make the Cornbread

2 Cups cornmeal                 2 eggs
1 tsp. salt                     1/4 Cup melted fat
1 tsp. soda                     buttermilk

Heat  8  inch  pan  smoking hot with 2 Tablespoons fat in 450 oven.  Mix
ingredients adding enough buttermilk to make a batter just  thin  enough
to  pour  -  1  to  2 Cups.  Pour batter in pan and bake at 450 about 30
minutes.

Can use the same ingredients except buttermilk  and  soda.   Instead  of
buttermilk,  use  milk  and 4 teaspoons of baking powder in place of the
soda.

Dressing

1 Pan of cornbread (8 Cups)     10 slices of white bread (4 Cups)
2 Cups finely chopped celery    1 stick oleo
1 Cup  finely chopped onion     3 beaten eggs
1 tsp salt                      2-3 Cups chicken broth
1/2 tsp pepper                  1/2 tsp sage

Toast white bread until dry.  Break up  corn  bread  and  toasted  white
bread  into pieces no bigger than your thumb.  Melt oleo in a frying pan
and SLOWLY fry the celery and onions until the onions are a pale,  straw
color.   Beat  eggs with a fork and mix into the broken bread along with
salt, pepper, and sage.  Combine with celery and onion and  moisten  all
with just enough chicken broth to hold the dressing together.

Stuff  turkey VERY LOOSELY as dressing will swell during roasting.  Bake
left over dressing in uncovered pan or casserole at 375 for  45  minutes
after  adding  enough  additional  chicken  broth to make "soupy" (thick
soup).

Roasting the Bird

              Roasting Time for Stuffed Turkey in 325 Oven

Purchased                                           Covered
 Weight                           Open Pan        in Dark Enamel

 8 to 12 lbs                    3 1/2-4     hrs   3    -3 1/2 hrs
12 to 16 lbs                    4    -4 1/2 hrs   3 1/2-4     hrs
16 to 20 lbs                    4 1/2-5     hrs   4    -4 1/2 hrs
20 to 24 lbs                    5    -6     hrs   4 1/2-5     hrs

If  a  shiny  aluminum  covered  roaster is used, it may be necessary to
increase cooking time up to 1 hour.  Remove cover for the last 1/2  hour
if further browning is desired.

Baste  often  (approximately  every  30  minutes) with chicken broth and
drippings.  In open pan  roasting,  cover  with  cheesecloth  soaked  in
chicken  broth  or  aluminum  foil  "tent" if the turkey is browning too
rapidly.

Tests for Doneness

1. Thigh temperature should be  180  to  185 F.   For  further  testing,
   remove  thermometer  from  thigh  and  place  in  center of stuffing.
   Temperature should be 160 to 165 F.

2. Protecting fingers with paper or cloth, press  thigh  and  drumstick.
   The meat should feel soft.

3. When thigh skin is pricked, juices should no longer be pink.

After  turkey  is  removed from oven, let stand 20-30 minutes for easier
carving.

Giblets

The gizzard, heart, liver and neck should be cooked promptly after being
cleaned and washed.  They must be cooked tender before they are added to
gravy.  Use giblet broth as liquid in gravy.

Cover gizzard, heart, and neck with water.  Season with 1 teaspoon salt,
3 peppercorns, 3 whole cloves, a small bayleaf,  and  a  little  chopped
onion,  celery, and carrot.  Simmer 1 1/2 hours or more until gizzard is
fork tender.  Add liver 10 to 20  minutes  (depending  on  size)  before
giblets are done. Refrigerate unless used immediately.

Brown Turkey Gravy

Ingredients                     For 2 Cups        For 4 Cups

  Fat (from turkey drippings)   3 Tablespoons     6 Tablespoons
  Flour                         3 1/2 Tblsp       7 Tablespoons
  Broth and nonfat drippings    2 Cups            4 Cups

Allow  about  1/4  cup of gravy for each serving.  Pour drippings into a
bowl leaving the solid brown particles in the roasting pan.  Scrape  out
solid  brown particles into a large skillet or simply loosen if gravy is
to be made in the roasting pan.

Skim all fat from drippings.  Measure the amount of fat needed for gravy
and mix with solid particles.  Set fat over low surface heat.  Blend  in
flour  and  cook until bubbly, stirring constantly.  Add liquid which is
cool or lukewarm (not hot) all at once.  Cook over medium heat, stirring
constantly until uniformly thickened and bubbly.  Lower heat and  simmer
gently about 5 minutes.  Season to taste with salt and pepper.
