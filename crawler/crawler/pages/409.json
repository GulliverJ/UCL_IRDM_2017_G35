The following sequence of points describes a polygon: (0,0), (8,16),\n(-2,8), (2,8), (-8,16), (closing the polygon at (0,0)).  Discuss\nwhether the following points are "inside" or "outside" of the polygon,\ngiving the reasons for your decision in each case:\n\n\n    <hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_12.htm">Chapter 12</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Tue Oct 02 09:34:25 GMT Daylight Time 2001\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
