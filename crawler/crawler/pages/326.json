         b'e clearly identified as such by being  placed inside quotation marks'
         b', and students should identify their  sources as accurately and full'
         b'y as possible. A series of short  quotations from several different '
         b'sources, if not clearly identified as  such, constitutes plagiarism '
         b'just as much as does a single  unacknowledged long quotation from a '

         b'eas, judgements, figures, software or diagrams, a reference to that '

         b' reports) or of outside  word-processing agencies which offer correc'

         b' make use of the services of such agencies render themselves liable '
         b'for an academic penalty.</li><li>Use of unacknowledged information d'
         b'ownloaded from the internet also constitutes plagiarism.</li><li>Whe'
         b"re part of an examination consists of 'take away'  papers, essays or"
         b" other work written in a student's own time, or a  coursework assess"

         b'also illicit to reproduce material which a student  has used in othe'
         b'r work/assessment for the course or programmes  concerned. Students '
         b'should be aware of this \xe2\x80\x98self-plagiarism\xe2\x80\x99. I'
         b'f in  doubt, students should consult their Personal Tutor or another'
         b'  appropriate teacher.</li><li>Failure to observe any of the provisi'
         b'ons of this policy or of approved departmental guidelines constitute'
         b's an examination offence  under UCL and University Regulations. Exam'
         b'ination offences will normally be treated as cheating or irregularit'
         b'ies under the Regulations in  respect of Examination Irregularities.'
         b' Under these Regulations students  found to have committed an offenc'
         b'e may be excluded from all further  examinations of UCL or the Unive'
         b'rsity or of both.</li><li>The expression of original ideas is consid'
         b'ered  intellectual property, and is protected by copyright laws, jus'
         b't like  original inventions. Almost all forms of expression fall und'
         b'er copyright protection as long as they are recorded in some way (su'
         b'ch as a book or a computer file).</li></ul><p><b>Please take this&nb'
         b'sp;information very seriously.</b> There have been cases in the past'
         b' in which students have been found to have cheated by copying the wo'
         b'rk of other students and submitting this as their own. UCL takes an '
         b'extremely serious view of plagiarism. Students found to have been ch'
         b'eating may be given a mark of 0% for the work in question. In severe'
         b" cases all of a student's results for the year can be declared void "
         b'and he/she can be sent down for a year. Persistent offenders may be '
         b'permanently excluded from UCL. Note that, when plagiarism is discove'
         b'red, it is not normally obvious which piece of work is the original '
         b'from which the others have been copied. This means that all those in'
         b'volved, including one possibly innocent party, come under suspicion.'
         b' \r</p>\n<p>Computer Science students are perhaps especially vulne'
         b'rable since much of the material they deal with is electronic and he'
         b'nce easy to copy. For example, if you find information or software o'
         b'n the&nbsp;internet which helps you with a piece of coursework you <'
         b'b>must</b> acknowledge your source. The acknowledgement must be prec'
         b'ise indicating exactly what was the source and which sections of you'
         b'r work are affected. If it turns out that an almost complete solutio'
         b'n to a problem is available on the internet, you should report that '
         b'fact - it is then a problem for the lecturer rather than for you! Yo'
         b"u should avoid looking at other students' solutions or allowing othe"
         b"rs to look at yours; once you have see someone else's solution it is"
         b' virtually impossible for you to erase it from your memory and produ'
         b'ce your own independent work. \r</p>\n<p>Note that we do not wish '
         b'to discourage students from discussing their work with fellow studen'
         b'ts and collaborating in solving problems. However you should avoid a'
         b'llowing the collaborative phase to approach too close to a final sol'
         b'ution which might make it impossible for you to make your own distin'
         b'ctive intellectual contribution. The key point is that you must not '
         b"present the results of another person's work &quot;as though they we"
         b're your own&quot;. <b>If you feel that a substantial part of a piece'
         b' of work you submit for assessment has resulted from collaboration w'
         b'ith other students you must make that clear in writing before the wo'

         b' around collaborative working, the Departmental Teaching Committee ('
         b'DTC) agreed some guidelines, a copy of which you can read here: <a h'
