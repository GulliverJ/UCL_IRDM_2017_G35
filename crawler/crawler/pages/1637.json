         b' recent work on capturing design intent in high-level, linguistic te'
         b'rms. For example, the designer may want to make a virtual creature m'

         b'tural for humans, yet cannot be directly expressed in current interf'

         b'istic shape analysis to create a design interface that directly supp'
         b'orts such expression. The approach is data-driven: large repositorie'
         b's of existing designs are used to learn shared structure and semanti'
         b'cs, and repurposed for synthesizing new designs. I will conclude wit'
         b'h a discussion of directions, opportunities and challenges for new t'

         b'cturing and resampling the planar components, before reconstructing '
         b'the surface from both the consolidated components and the unstructur'
