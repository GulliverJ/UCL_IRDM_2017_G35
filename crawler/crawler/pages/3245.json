         b's</a> other one, which explains that this destructive behaviour may '
         b'be explained by the lack of online identiy. Here is a quote from the'
         b' article: <span id="more-107"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>Social '
         b'psychologists have known for decades that, if we reduce our sense of'

         b'duation</a> \xe2\x80\x93 we are less likely to stick to social no'
         b'rms. For example, in the 1960s <a href="http://www.mdhs.unimelb.edu.'
         b'au/research/R-D/leonmann.html">Leon Mann</a> studied a nasty phenome'
         b'non called &#8220;suicide baiting&#8221; \xe2\x80\x93 when someon'
         b'e threatening to jump from a high building is . Mann found that peop'
         b'le were more likely to do this if they were part of a large crowd, i'
         b'f the jumper was above the 7th floor, and if it was dark. These are '
         b'all factors that allowed the observers to lose their own individuali'
         b'ty.</p>\n<p>Social psychologist <a href="http://faculty.chicagogs'
         b'b.edu/nicholas.epley/">Nicholas Epley</a> argues that much the same '
         b'thing happens with online communication such as email. Psychological'
         b'ly, we are &#8220;distant&#8221; from the person we&#8217;re talking'
         b' to and less focused on our own identity. As a result we&#8217;re mo'
         b're prone to aggressive behaviour, he says.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>'
         b'What this seems to say is that we need a strong sense of online iden'
         b'tity in order to promote social behaviour; hence the need to transfe'
         b'r concepts such as trust and reputation to the online world. However'

         b' to be; where is the balance between the social utility of identity '

         b'/a>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<p>Good point, I hadn&#8217;t thought about &'
         b'#8220;voluntary&#8221; implying an individual making the decision. B'
         b'ut are decisions really made by individuals rather than identities?<'
         b'/p>\n<p>I&#8217;d argue that a decision-making self is defined, a'
         b'bove all, by consistency: &#8220;being true to yourself&#8221; means'
         b' remaining consistent when there&#8217;s pressure to be inconsistent'
         b'. &#8220;That&#8217;s just the way I do things.&#8221; &#8220;He&#82'
         b'17;s not that kind of person.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the other hand, i'
         b'nconsistency implies a rupture of the self. &#8220;I&#8217;m not the'
         b' same person as I was in those days.&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s a diff'
         b'erent person when he&#8217;s drunk.&#8221; &#8220;She&#8217;s reinve'
         b'nted herself.&#8221; &#8220;How can you say that? The other day you '
         b'said the opposite.&#8221;</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s much less exp'
         b'ectation of consistency across roles &#8211; indeed you could almost'
         b' say that roles are defined by inconsistency. I don&#8217;t treat th'
         b'e members of my family the same way I treat customers at work or str'
         b'angers on the tube, and it would be considered very strange if I did'
         b'. My behaviour as an individual is inconsistent from hour to hour, b'
         b'ut within each role my behaviour is expected to be consistent across'
         b' long periods of time.</p>\n<p>But that seems to lead to a parado'
         b'x: if decisions are taken by consistent identities, how can an ident'
         b'ity ever choose to create a new identity that may behave inconsisten'
         b'tly? I guess Deleuze in his pessimistic moments would argue that it '
         b'doesn&#8217;t work that way: roles are imposed from the outside and '
         b'their conflicting requirements create conflicting identities &#8211;'
         b' involuntary dividuation.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s possible to '
         b'take a less fatalistic view if we accept that externally consistent '
         b'identities may contain internal tensions that can either be explored'
         b', if there are opportunities to create new identities, or suppressed'
         b', if there&#8217;s pressure to remain consistent. (I&#8217;m not hap'
         b'py with this loaded language but I&#8217;m not sure how else to expr'
         b'ess it &#8211; fragmentation vs integration would cast the shadow on'
         b' the opposite side, I guess.)</p>\n<p>So maybe dividuation can be'
         b' seen as a kind of branching process subject to a mixture of interna'
         b'l and external pressures to divide or cohere. But that sounds terrib'
         b'ly mechanistic&#8230;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d probably better leave the'
         b' question of crowd psychology for another night, I&#8217;ve rambled '
