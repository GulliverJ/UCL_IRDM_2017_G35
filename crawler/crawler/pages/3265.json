         b'e that a decision-making self is defined, above all, by consistency:'
         b' &quot;being true to yourself&quot; means remaining consistent when '

         b'self. &quot;I&#039;m not the same person as I was in those days.&quo'
         b't; &quot;He&#039;s a different person when he&#039;s drunk.&quot; &q'

         b'eat the members of my family the same way I treat customers at work '
         b'or strangers on the tube, and it would be considered very strange if'
         b' I did. My behaviour as an individual is inconsistent from hour to h'
         b'our, but within each role my behaviour is expected to be consistent '
         b'across long periods of time.\r\n\r\nBut that seems to lead to a para'
