         b'ave been found to have cheated by copying the work of other students'
         b' and submitting this as their own. UCL takes an extremely serious vi'
         b'ew of plagiarism. Students found to have been cheating may be given '
         b'a mark of 0% for the work in question. In severe cases all of a stud'
         b"ent's results for the year can be declared void and he/she can be se"
         b'nt down for a year. Persistent offenders may be permanently excluded'

         b'lly obvious which piece of work is the original from which the other'

         b'er Science students are perhaps especially vulnerable since much of '

         b'ke it impossible for you to make your own distinctive intellectual c'
         b'ontribution. The key point is that you must not present the results '
