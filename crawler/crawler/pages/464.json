The programme defines \r      the behaviour of a set of agents moving from one side of the space to the \r      other. The programme is interfaced with a camera interface allowing the \r      agents to see brightness values in the real world. When the agents come \r      across dark patches (moving or not) they will avoid these.</p>\r    <p>The agents move in respect to vision: the agents see the goal (attractor) \r      and move towards it. In Crossings the agents see the opposite side of the \r      space from which they are born. Moving across the space they avoid to bump \r      into each other. This creates neat paths negotiating the space. In Crossings \r      this is visualised at a trace. At present this is as a literal trail, in \r      the future this could be as a particle stream emitted from the agent itself.</p>\r    <p><img src="research/images/ANInotraces.gif" width="450" height="143"></p>\r    <p>Behaviour of the agents (no trace and no tracking)</p>\r    <p><img src="research/images/ANI_traces.gif" width="450" height="174"></p>\r    <p>Behaviour of the agents with trace (no tracking)</p>\r    <p><img src="research/images/ANIstopframe.gif" width="450" height="323"></p>\r    <p>Behaviour of the agents with trace and tracking</p>\r    <p>&nbsp;</p>\r    <h3>The parameters for the agents are: </h3>\r    <h3>Space: </h3>\r    <p>The agents have a certain size and movement quality by which they seek \r      the attractor.

The particles streams are sited in an environment \r      which holds certain properties such as gravity and perhaps vortexes (these \r      might be better conceived as active attractors perhaps mapped (in some instances) \r      to the presence of the performers).</p>\r    <p>Following Chiron\xd5s suggestion the particle system will be determined through \r      its flow across an (invisible) surface. The surface is informed by the interface \r      as well as the agents behaviour (speed of movement?). As the movement across \r      the (Mixed Reality) surface slows down the surface deforms creating deep \r      crevices. The surface is continually in a process of deformation thereby \r      controlling the movement of the particles. </p>\r    <p><img src="research/images/ANIparticleterrain.gif" width="450" height="356"></p>\r    <h3>Vision </h3>\r    <p>The agents operate through their ability to \xd4see\xd5 their environment.

Similar behavior can be seen in \r      systems described by ordinary differential flows and discrete mappings. \r      In nonlinear dynamical systems, the transition from self-organizing to chaotic \r      behavior is sometimes referred to as a phase transition (or, more specifically, \r      as an order-disorder transition).</p>\r  </div>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <h2>&nbsp; </h2>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r</div>\r<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; left:95px; top:270px; width:175px; height:200px; z-index:3"> \r  <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\r    <tr> \r      <td><h1 align="right">Crossings </h1>\r        <p align="right"><a href="crossings.html">Idea </a></p>\r        <p align="right">First workshop: Roehampton University 21/02.05<br>\r          <a href="crossings_para.html"> - preparations</a><br>\r          <a href="crossings_wrkshp1.html">-stills</a><br>\r          <a href="crossings_wrkshp1_cs.html">- contactsheets<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_vis1.html">- visualisation ideas<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_seaweed.html">- graphical seaweeds<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_seaweed_ani.html">-seaweed animation<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_meshdesign.html">- mesh designs</a></p>\r        <p align="right"><a href="crossings_vis2.html">- new visualisation</a><br>\r          <a href="crossings_mesh_logic.html">- mesh coding logic</a><br>\r        </p>\r        <p align="right">Second workshop: The Place<br>\r          April 05<br>\r          <a href="crossings_wrkshp2.html">- stills </a></p>\r        <p align="right"><a href="crossings_fabrica.html">Fabrica submission</a></p></td>\r    </tr>\r  </table>\r  <h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r</div>\r</body>\r</html>\r',
