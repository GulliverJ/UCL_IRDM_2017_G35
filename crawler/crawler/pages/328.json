The virtual \r    environment is an abstract digital dimension called into being by the interactions \r    of the user. The coupling of sound and movement is intended to locate interaction \r    outside known actions from the physical environment.</p>\r  <p><img src="images/iswyhCave1.jpg" width="450" height="112"></p>\r  <p>Initially designed for the CAVE, users enter the environment wearing a wireless \r    microphone as well as stereoscopic shutter glasses and the CAVE head tracker. \r    Users are asked to engage with the environment through sound and movement \r    interaction. As users interact by different vocal (talking, singing and making \r    noises) as well as physical sounds (clapping, stamping and clicking) vividly \r    coloured spline surfaces appear in the display environment.</p>\r  <p><img src="images/iswyhCave2.jpg" width="450" height="112"></p>\r  <p>The surfaces are reactive to the sound parameters of pitch (informing the \r    Y-axis of the splines), volume (X-axis) and duration (Z-axis). The splines \r    are generated in real-time, concurrently with the users sound production. \r    The splines are generated at 1metre per second, long sounds producing long \r    splines, short sounds, such as clapping, stamping or clicking, producing short \r    splines. Past splines remain frozen in space and time, while active splines \r    can be moved and changed by the users continual interactions. </p>\r  <p>Users engage in the experience of the digital environment learning to engage \r    with the parameters of interaction. The interest in I see what you hear is \r    to enable the user to form new embodied practices. Interaction becomes the \r    process of learning to experience agency and inhabitation within an environment \r    particular to the presence and actions of the user. </p>\r  <p><em>I see what you hear</em>, CAVE was developed in collaboration with computer \r    scientist David Swapp.</p>\r  <p><a href="iswyhCAVE.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow(\'iswyhC_mov_high.html\',\'video\',\'width=330,height=265\')">video \r    high res (8.6 mb)</a><br>\r    <a href="iswyhCAVE.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow(\'iswyhC_mov_low.html\',\'video\',\'width=330,height=265\')">video \r    low res (2.6 mb)</a> </p>\r  </div>\r</body>\r</html>\r',
