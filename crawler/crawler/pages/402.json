In the case of the Sutherland-Hodgman polygon clipping, consider what should\n\nhappen if a polygon vertex is on a clipping boundary, or coincident with the\n\nvertex of the clip region. What should happen if an edge is (partially)&nbsp;\n\n\ncoincident with a boundary?<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n2. What will happen in the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm in the case of the\n\n\npolygon and clip region below?<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n<img src="chap10-1.gif" alt=" " width="64" height="56"><br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n3. \nIn the following diagram, the shape defined by the points a,b,c,d,e,f  is to be clipped to the viewing region A,B,C,D using the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm. The order of clipping will be AB then CD then BC then DA. Give details of the result of clipping at each of these four stages and state whether the final result is correct or incorrect.\n\n<br>\n\n\n<img src="chap10-2.gif" alt=" "><br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n4. In the discussion of Weiler-Atherton it was assumed that the set E is\nnotempty - that is, that there are intersections. Suppose there are none?\nConsider your answer with respect to polygon A of Figure 10.3.\n\n<br>\n\n<br>\n\n5. If you know that only convex polygons can be sent down the graphics\npipeline, what optimisation can you make to the Sutherland-Hodgman\nclipping algorithm?\n\n<br>\n\n<hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_10.htm">Chapter 10</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Sun Jul 20 20:46:49 BST 2003\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
