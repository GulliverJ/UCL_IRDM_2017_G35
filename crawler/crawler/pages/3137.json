         b'tp://www.recsys.acm.org/">RecSys &#8217;07</a>, and it was quite an '
         b'experience. The great thing about the conference was the balance bet'
         b'ween academic and industry representatives. Researchers from around '
         b'the world and representatives from some of the most well known recom'
         b'mender systems out there (Amazon, Netflix, MyStrands, etc).. teachin'
         b'g each other that even after a near decade of research, our understa'
         b'nding of recommender systems is only at it&#8217;s beginning. <span '
         b'id="more-94"></span></p>\n<p>The paper sessions were split into 4'
         b' sessions, each giving a different taste of current research:</p'
         b'>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy and trust (including a great presenation by <'
         b'a href="http://www.gnuband.org/">Paolo Massa</a> on his PhD work)</l'
         b'i>\n<li>Algorithms: Collaborative Filtering</li>\n<li>User Issues '
         b'in Recommender Systems</li>\n<li>Algorithms: Learning</li>\n</ul>\n'
         b'<p>Common themes ranged from grouping similar users to countering pr'
         b'ofile-injection attacks and using available user information to impr'
         b'ove the performance of these systems, each presented from a differen'
         b't point of view and an equal wide range of solutions. The conference'
         b' proceedings are definitely worth checking out for more information.'
         b' The demo and poster session was very interesting as well: I saw a d'
         b'emo of Claudio&#8217;s poolcasting (see <a href="http://mobblog.cs.u'
         b'cl.ac.uk/2007/09/18/poolcasting/">previous post</a>) and so many pos'
         b'ters that it is hard to write any kind of short summary of them. Con'
         b'clusion: the research work on recommender systems is very broad, and'
         b' highly active around the world.</p>\n<p>However, some of the mor'
         b'e interesting points came up during the panel sessions, which gave a'
         b' chance for the industry representatives to have their say, and for '
         b'ideas to bounce around. Some questions that came up:</p>\n<ul>\n<l'
         b'i><strong>Why are we building recommender systems?</strong> Short an'
         b'swer: no consensus. Read any research paper and it will discuss the '
         b'problem of information overload that users face. Ask a business runn'
         b'ing a web site and they will say that its a technology that will hel'
         b'p them make money (Netflix wouldn&#8217;t throw a  into a competitio'
         b'n to improve their algorithm if they didn&#8217;t think that they wo'
         b'uld make all that money.. and more.. back!)</li>\n<li><strong>How'
         b' should we properly evaluate recommender systems? </strong>Short ans'
         b'wer: no consensus. The industry representatives kept talking about u'
         b'ser experience, as if a researcher&#8217;s focus on precision/accura'
         b'cy metrics is somehow off the mark when it comes to actually deployi'
         b'ng these systems. They may be right; precision doesn&#8217;t measure'
         b' serendipity or interface issues. On the other hand, shouldn&#8217;t'
         b' the interface and underlying algorithm be separate issues? Also, do'
         b'n&#8217;t user ratings reflect the experiences that they are having '
         b'within the system- and therefore a highly accurate algorithm will be'
         b' able to provide a good experience? Considering user experience does'
         b'n&#8217;t exclude the need to be able to measure the performance of '
         b'algorithms- imagine if user-experience was one of the metrics used w'
         b'hen designing TCP!</li>\n<li><strong>Do we know when the recommen'
         b'der system problem has been solved?</strong> Short answer: No. (I do'
         b'n&#8217;t think anybody even tried answering this question)</li>'
         b'\n<li><strong>What is the difference between recommendations and '
         b'search? </strong>Personally (until the conference), I thought this m'
         b'atter was solved. Having a conference that is solely dedicated to re'
         b'commenders seemed to highlight this. Search, or information retrieva'
         b'l, is about helping a user find a target, through queries or single-'
         b'session model building. A recommender system, on the other hand, is '
         b'about presenting the user with targets without requiring any form of'
         b' query, by using a model of that user (and community) that has been '
         b'built over time. However, there was a lot of discussion about this; '
         b'the two fields still do overlap quite a bit. In particular, some pap'
         b'ers that were presented showed &#8220;recommendation systems&#8221; '
         b'that lead the user through a directed dialogue with the system in or'
         b'der to provide results (e.g. find a hotel based on these constraints'
         b').</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, a great conference. Great to finally b'
         b'e able to put faces to the authors that I&#8217;ve been reading in t'
         b'he past few months. But also a 2-day highlight of the inconsistencie'
         b's and unresolved issues surrounding academic and industry views of r'
         b'ecommender systems. Any thoughts?</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t'
