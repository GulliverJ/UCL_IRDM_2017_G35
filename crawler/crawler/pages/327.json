Spawn aims to conceive an embodied space by investigating presence \r    and being in environments that merge physical and virtual dimensions, Mixed \r    Realities. Questioning the limits of the body and its virtual representation, \r    Spawn fuses the thinking of embodiment and space with the design of creative \r    technologies for the interfacing and performance of digital environments. \r  </p>\r  <p align="center"><img src="images/spawn1.jpg" width="450" height="112"> </p>\r  <p>Spawn takes place on an interactive stage informed by a camera-based interface. \r    The camera tracking system identifies the shifting outlines of the dancers&#8217; \r    bodies which in turn becomes input for a virtual other, a digital morphology \r    shaped by the presence and movement of the performers. The virtual other is \r    a complex geometry comprising four circles stretching a spline-based membrane \r    between them. As the performers move they affect the virtual other deforming \r    and reforming, contracting and expanding, folding and unfolding its digital \r    skin. The visualisation of this kinetically modelled virtual other is projected \r    back into the physical space of the performance in real time, generating new \r    forms of interaction and creating a blended environment of real and virtual \r    spaces for a mobile audience.</p>\r  <p><img src="images/spawn2.jpg" width="450" height="112"></p>\r  <p>Research for Spawn explores the relearning of embodiment to accommodate the \r    expanded materiality of a performance environment which provides a platform \r    for the entwining of real and virtual forms. In Spawn the digital is conceived \r    as a separate dimension, informed by the embodied presence of the performer \r    while retaining an independent morphology and motility. Unlike other computer \r    interfaces for dance performance, such as Hypervision MoCap, the Spawn interface \r    does not seek to identify the user&#8217;s body parts and map them onto a \r    corresponding digital anatomy. Instead, a set of statistical characteristics \r    of the silhouettes size and shape are generated and updated in real-time. \r    This open relationship between physical and digital presence proposes the \r    overlapping perspectives of two distinct spatial narratives and their surface \r    tensions.</p>\r  <p><a href="spawn.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow(\'spawn_mov_high.html\',\'video\',\'width=330,height=265\')">video \r    high res (13 mb)</a> <br>\r    <a href="spawn.html" onClick="MM_openBrWindow(\'spawn_mov_low.html\',\'video\',\'width=330,height=265\')">video \r    low res (4 mb)</a></p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  </div>\r</body>\r</html>\r',
