Give the transformation matrices that can turn the following arrangement to a canonical perspective.\n<br>\n<center>\n<img src="chap9-1.gif" alt=" " >\n</center>\n\n2. Suppose that a canonical perspective space is defined as follows: It is a left handed system as usual, the COP is at  (0,0,-1), the viewplane  distance is zero (ie, the viewplane is the xy plane through the origin), and the view plane window is the triangle defined by (1,1,0), (-1,1,0) and (0,-1,0). No front and back clipping planes are specified.\n\n<p>\n\n2(a). What are the plane equations of the three bounding planes of this view volume?\n\n<p>\n\n2(b). The usual clipping region for x and y in perspective space can be expressed as -z &lt= x &lt= z, and -z &lt= y &lt= z. Express this new clipping region in a similar form, using inequalities.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>\n\n2(c). Clip the polygon (1,3,2), (-1,0,2), (0,0,0) against the defined viewing volume.\t\n\n    <hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_9.htm">Chapter 9</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Tue Oct 02 09:33:55 GMT Daylight Time 2001\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
