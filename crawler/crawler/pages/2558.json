{'html': b'Title: On the use of Event-B in Modelling Data Sharing Agreement'
         b's\r\n\r\nAbstract: Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs) are parts of legal'
         b' contracts specifying, in constrained natural languages, how data ma'
         b'y be shared among different organisations.  In this talk, I will pre'
         b'sent an approach for modelling and verifying DSAs using the Event-B '
         b'method.  The work presented was part of the EU FP7 project CONSEQUEN'
         b'CE.  The approach captures the notions of permissions, prohibitions '
         b'and obligations to some limited degree.',
