If there are any conflicts between what is stated in this document and the official UCL rules then it is, of course, the UCL rules which apply. Students should refer in particular to:\r</p>\n<p>1.

With one or two exceptions CS modules are worth 0.5 Course-units (15 FHEQ credits). Typically, a CS module is taught as about 30 hours of lectures plus tutorials, computer lab classes,&nbsp;help sessions and so on. We expect that, normally, the workload for a 0.5 Course-unit (15 FHEQ credit) module is about&nbsp;150 Learning hours when lectures, exercises, coursework, reading, revision etc. are totalled. Some modules are compulsory whilst others are chosen from a range of options. Such choices must always be with the approval of the Departmental Tutor. Further details of the rules concerning choices can be found in the <a href="mobile/current_students/undergrad_inf/curriculum/" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">curriculum pages</a>.&nbsp; The number of credits you pass or fail determines whether you are allowed to progress to the next year of the&nbsp;programme and, ultimately, whether you will be awarded a degree.&nbsp; \r</p>\n<h3><b>Levels of modules:</b></h3>\n<p>Modules are defined in terms of levels as follows:\r</p>\n<p>(a) basic/introductory (level 3 - ie at a level below that of a normal first-year module);\r</p>\n<p>(b) first level (level 4 - ie COMP101P, COMP102P etc)\r</p>\n<p>(c) intermediate level (level 5 - ie COMP201P, COMP202P etc)\r</p>\n<p>(d) advanced level (level 6 - ie COMP3005, COMP3072 etc)\r</p>\n<p>(e) masters level (level 7 - ie COMPM012, COMPM061 etc)\r</p>\n<p>The following rules then apply:\r</p>\n<p>(a) students may take a maximum of 5.0 Course-units (150 FHEQ credits) at first level (level 4) and a minimum of 3.0 Course-units (90 FHEQ credits) at advanced level (level 6) in order to be awarded a BSc Honours degree;\r</p>\n<p>(b) students may take no more than 0.5 Course-units (15 FHEQ credits) at basic/introductory level in order to be awarded an Honours degree;\r</p>\n<p>(c) students must take at least 1.0 Course-units (30 FHEQ credits) at advanced level in order to be awarded an Ordinary degree;\r</p>\n<p>(d) for 16.0 Course-unit MEng programmes, students must take at least 4.0 Course-units (120 FHEQ credits) at Master\'s (M) level.\r</p>\n<h3><b>To pass a module, you must:</b></h3>\n<p>(a) be \'complete\' in the module (please see the section <a href="mobile/current_students/undergrad_inf/assessment/#c7059" title="Opens internal link in current window" class="internal-link">\'How are CS modules&nbsp;assessed</a>); and\r</p>\n<p>(b) achieve the pass mark (please see the table below)</p><table class="greytable"><thead><tr><th>For all Computer Science undergraduate modules: </th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The pass mark for 1st, 2nd and 3rd year modules&nbsp;= 40%.

The Computer Science Board is attended by External Examiners as well as members of the Department and representatives of the Faculty. The role of the External Examiners is to see that standards are maintained and that all students are treated fairly. The percentage marks you obtain help the examiners to determine the class of degree you will be awarded. The final mark is a weighted average of the marks you obtain in the modules you take throughout your studies. <b>Note that the process is not entirely mechanical and the examiners are required to use their judgement and discretion.&nbsp;</b>\r</p>\n<p>Examiners may take note of all relevant information, and any special factors such as certified disability or illness, before making the final recommendation of Honours Class.\r</p>\n<p>Students who have acquired credits from another UCL degree programme prior to joining the CS Department might reach 11 credits before the end of their final year. Students in such a position must formally apply to &quot;postpone honours&quot; so that they can proceed to the final year. Please contact the <a href="mailto:G.Roberts@cs.ucl.ac.uk">Departmental Tutor</a> about this if it applies to you. \r</p>\n<h3><b>Honours Degrees</b></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;An initial assessment of Honours Class is made with reference to the following values:</p><table class="greytable"><thead><tr><th>Mean Mark % </th><th>Class Awarded</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>70</td><td>First</td></tr><tr><td>60-69</td><td>Upper Second</td></tr><tr><td>50-59</td><td>Lower Second</td></tr><tr><td>40-49</td><td>Third</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><b>Ordinary Degrees</b></h3>\n<p>Students entering in 2005/06 and thereafter may be awarded an Ordinary Degree if they have failed to meet the criteria for an Honours Degree. To be eligible for an Ordinary Degree students must have accumulated at total of at least 11.0 completed Course-units, with a minimum of 10.0 Course-units passed, with the number of passes at advanced level being not less than 2.0 Course-units for a 12.0 Course-unit programme.

Binary marked coursework does contribute to the final mark for the module but the contribution will be no more than 15%.</dd> <dt>Mini-test</dt> <dd>Some modules include one or more mini-tests, part-way through the term to help you test your progress.

If the student passes the resit attempt, the mark will <b>not</b> be capped at 40%;</li><li> opt not to resit and keep the mark gained up to the value of 1.0 Course-unit maximum, having sought academic advice. &nbsp; </li></ul><p>If a continuing student opts to retain a failed mark, this would be treated as a \xe2\x80\x9cfail with credit\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e. it counts as completion of a module but without a pass mark), and students can only have one of these not to jeopardise the final classification. \r</p>\n<p>For students who have been referred and who then fail the referred assessment, unless they have used all their resit attempts, they will resit at the next normal opportunity. \r</p>\n<p>There are no circumstances whereby a student, who has failed a CS module at below 35% (or below 30% for certain modules in the Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences), would be allowed to take the module at any other time other than the next normal opportunity. \r</p>\n<p>If students are incomplete (i.e. where they have not attempted all elements of all assessments for a given module), the incomplete module will count as one of their attempts. &nbsp; Students with an incomplete result will not normally be expected to resit any piece of assessment passed: they would normally be expected to resit only the part failed at the next normal occasion. </p>\n\t\t<!--  Text: [end] -->\n\t\t\t</div><p class="csc-linkToTop"><a href="mobile/current_students/undergrad_inf/assessment/#">To top</a></p>\n\t<!--  CONTENT ELEMENT, uid:7068/text [end] -->\n\t\t\n\t<!--  CONTENT ELEMENT, uid:7069/text [begin] -->\n\t\t<div id="c7069" class="csc-frame csc-frame-rulerAfter">\n\t\t<!--  Header: [begin] -->\n\t\t\t<div class="csc-header csc-header-n15"><h2>Plagiarism</h2></div>\n\t\t<!--  Header: [end] -->\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<!--  Text: [begin] -->\n\t\t\t<p>Your attention is drawn to UCL\'s&nbsp;information&nbsp;on plagiarism at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/guidelines/plagiarism" target="_top">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/current-students/guidelines/plagiarism</a>:</p><ul><li>Plagiarism is defined as the presentation of another  person\'s thoughts or words or artefacts or software as though they were a student\'s own. Any quotation from the published or unpublished works of other persons must, therefore, be clearly identified as such by being  placed inside quotation marks, and students should identify their  sources as accurately and fully as possible. A series of short  quotations from several different sources, if not clearly identified as  such, constitutes plagiarism just as much as does a single  unacknowledged long quotation from a single source. Equally, if a  student summarises another person\'s ideas, judgements, figures, software or diagrams, a reference to that person in the text must be made and  the work referred to must be included in the bibliography.</li><li>  Recourse to the services of \'ghost-writing\' agencies (for  example in the preparation of essays or reports) or of outside  word-processing agencies which offer correction/improvement of English  is strictly forbidden, and students who make use of the services of such agencies render themselves liable for an academic penalty.</li><li>Use of unacknowledged information downloaded from the internet also constitutes plagiarism.</li><li>Where part of an examination consists of \'take away\'  papers, essays or other work written in a student\'s own time, or a  coursework assessment, the work submitted must be the candidate\'s own.</li><li>It is also illicit to reproduce material which a student  has used in other work/assessment for the course or programmes  concerned. Students should be aware of this \xe2\x80\x98self-plagiarism\xe2\x80\x99. If in  doubt, students should consult their Personal Tutor or another  appropriate teacher.</li><li>Failure to observe any of the provisions of this policy or of approved departmental guidelines constitutes an examination offence  under UCL and University Regulations. Examination offences will normally be treated as cheating or irregularities under the Regulations in  respect of Examination Irregularities. Under these Regulations students  found to have committed an offence may be excluded from all further  examinations of UCL or the University or of both.</li><li>The expression of original ideas is considered  intellectual property, and is protected by copyright laws, just like  original inventions. Almost all forms of expression fall under copyright protection as long as they are recorded in some way (such as a book or a computer file).</li></ul><p><b>Please take this&nbsp;information very seriously.</b> There have been cases in the past in which students have been found to have cheated by copying the work of other students and submitting this as their own. UCL takes an extremely serious view of plagiarism. Students found to have been cheating may be given a mark of 0% for the work in question. In severe cases all of a student\'s results for the year can be declared void and he/she can be sent down for a year. Persistent offenders may be permanently excluded from UCL. Note that, when plagiarism is discovered, it is not normally obvious which piece of work is the original from which the others have been copied. This means that all those involved, including one possibly innocent party, come under suspicion. \r</p>\n<p>Computer Science students are perhaps especially vulnerable since much of the material they deal with is electronic and hence easy to copy. For example, if you find information or software on the&nbsp;internet which helps you with a piece of coursework you <b>must</b> acknowledge your source. The acknowledgement must be precise indicating exactly what was the source and which sections of your work are affected. If it turns out that an almost complete solution to a problem is available on the internet, you should report that fact - it is then a problem for the lecturer rather than for you! You should avoid looking at other students\' solutions or allowing others to look at yours; once you have see someone else\'s solution it is virtually impossible for you to erase it from your memory and produce your own independent work. \r</p>\n<p>Note that we do not wish to discourage students from discussing their work with fellow students and collaborating in solving problems. However you should avoid allowing the collaborative phase to approach too close to a final solution which might make it impossible for you to make your own distinctive intellectual contribution. The key point is that you must not present the results of another person\'s work &quot;as though they were your own&quot;. <b>If you feel that a substantial part of a piece of work you submit for assessment has resulted from collaboration with other students you must make that clear in writing before the work is marked.</b>\r</p>\n<p>In order to clarify some of the issues around collaborative working, the Departmental Teaching Committee (DTC) agreed some guidelines, a copy of which you can read here: <a href="fileadmin/UCL-CS/images/students/Plagiarism_and_coursework.pdf" title="Initiates file download" class="download">Guidelines to clarify issues of collaborative working in coursework</a>.\r</p>\n<p>You must complete a coversheet for each piece of coursework and attach it to the front of your work.&nbsp; Copies of the coversheet are available from the Departmental Office, or can be printed from the web at <a href="fileadmin/UCL-CS/students/documents/cwsheet.pdf" title="Initiates file download" class="download">http://www-typo3.cs.ucl.ac.uk/students/student_information/coursework_cover_sheet/</a> You should note that UCL has now signed up to use a sophisticated detection system (JISC Turn-It-In) to scan work for evidence of plagiarism, and the Department intends to use this for assessed coursework.&nbsp; This system gives access to billions of sources, as well as work previously submitted to the department, UCL and other universities.\r</p>\n<p>You may have worked hard on a solution but has been quite unable to make progress. Do not try to solve this problem by copying. Instead, explain to the lecturer what has happened either in person or in writing. Keep copies of the preliminary work you have done (rough notes etc.) as evidence that you have tried. You will not be declared &quot;not complete&quot; if you can show you have made a serious attempt at a piece of work even if this was not successful.</p>\n\t\t<!--  Text: [end] -->\n\t\t\t</div><p class="csc-linkToTop"><a href="mobile/current_students/undergrad_inf/assessment/#">To top</a></p>\n\t<!--  CONTENT ELEMENT, uid:7069/text [end] -->\n\t\t\n\t<!--  CONTENT ELEMENT, uid:7070/text [begin] -->\n\t\t<div id="c7070" class="csc-frame csc-frame-rulerAfter">\n\t\t<!--  Text: [begin] -->\n\t\t\t\n<p>Please email any comments or queries to the Teaching and Learning Manager (<a href="mailto:teachingadmin@cs.ucl.ac.uk">teachingadmin@cs.ucl.ac.uk</a>)</p>\n\t\t<!--  Text: [end] -->\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t<!--  CONTENT ELEMENT, uid:7070/text [end] -->\n\t\t   \t                                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t                                                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n    </div>    \r\n\t\t<!-- End of main Div -->                 \r\n\t\t<!-- Start of footer Div -->                 \r\n    <div id="footer"> \r\n\t\t\t<div id="ownership"> \r\n\t\t\t\t<!-- ###RESPONSIBLE### begin -->   \r\n\t\t\t\t<!-- ###RESPONSIBLE### end -->   \r\n\t\t\t\t<div id="copyright">\t  \t                                                      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&#169; 1999-2016 UCL                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t    </div>\r\n\t\t\t<div id="engfac">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href="http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<img src="fileadmin/UCL-CS/web_assets/other_images/ucle_logo_trans.png" id="ucl_eng_logo" alt="UCL Engineering Logo"/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class="clearblock"></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t    \r\n\t\t\t<div id="disclaimer">\t\r\n\t\t\t\t<div id="list1">                                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul>    \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href="current_students/undergrad_inf/assessment/">Desktop Site</a>                                        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>              \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>                                                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/accessibility/" title="Accessibility" target="_top">Accessibility</a>                       \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\t\t                             \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>                                                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/help/?noMobile=0" title="Help" target="_top">Help</a>                      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\t                                            \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>    \r\n\t\t\t\t</div>      \r\n\t\t\t\t<div id="list2">   \r\n\t\t\t\t\t<ul>                   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>                                                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/disclaimer/" title="Disclaimer" target="_top">Disclaimer</a>                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>                                 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>                                                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/cookies/" title="Cookies" target="_top">Cookies</a>                      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li> \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>                                                     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/priv/" title="Privacy" target="_top">Privacy</a>                       \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>                                 \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\t \r\n\t\t\t\t</div>                                           \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</div>\t\r\n\t\t\t<div class="clearblock"></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n    </div>\r\n\t\t<!-- End of footer Div -->\n\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>',
