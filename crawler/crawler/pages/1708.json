         b'y Group of the UCL \nDepartment of Computer Science, funded by th'
         b'e Government Communications Headquarters \n(GCHQ). The successful'
         b' candidate will also be a member of the Programming Principles, Logi'
         b'c, \nand Verification (PPLV) Group. The studentship is open only '
         b"to UK nationals because of the \nfunder's eligibility requirement"

         b"ternship of approximately 2 - 4 weeks per year at GCHQ's headquarter"
         b's in Cheltenham. \nTo be considered for this studentship, candida'
         b"tes must therefore be prepared to undergo \nGCHQ's security clear"

         b'ioural issues that affect \nthe extent to which an implemented sy'

         b'p \na framework for modelling access control policies and their i'
         b'mplementation in system architectures \nand will provide tools fo'
         b'r reasoning about the circumvention of policies in the presence of b'
         b'ehaviours \nthat are driven by competing priorities (the policy-i'
         b'mplementation gap). Thus the project will address \nproblems that'
         b' of significant concern in business contexts using rigorous mathemat'
         b'ical and/or \ncomputational tools. The project build on and integ'
         b'rate aspects three scientific literatures: within \ncomputer/info'
         b'rmation security, the study of access control models, such as Bell L'
         b'a Padula, Biba, \nand Chinese Walls; within logic/theoretical com'
         b'puter science, frameworks for modelling and reasoning \nabout acc'
         b'ess control policies in system contexts; and, within usable security'
         b' and security economics, \nthe study of how individuals and organ'
         b'izations place different values on the benefits and costs of \nbe'
         b'haviours associated with security policies. \n\n<p>\n\nAll research '

         b"eaches often arise as a result of users' failure to comply with secu"
         b'rity \npolicies or follow good security practice, even when the i'
         b'mplications of such behaviour \nare known to them. Simple example'
         b's include the use of unencrypted USB sticks for the \ntransport o'
         b'f sensitive information, or connecting to public WiFi networks despi'
         b'te the \nwell-known dangers of so doing. There is evidence that t'
         b'his failure to comply with \npolicy arises from the perception th'
         b'at the benefit of compliance is outweighed by \nthe reduction in '
         b"users' ability to complete their tasks when complying. In recent"
         b' \nwork we have proposed a qualitative analysis of the concept of'
         b" 'compliance budget': \nthe idea that users have a finite budget "
         b'of time and energy available for such costly \ncompliance activit'
         b'ies, beyond which they begin to deviate from secure behaviour. \n'
         b'Compliance Budget Logic is a multi-modal logic incorporating a notio'
         b"n of preference \nwhich we use to describe and explain users' sec"
         b'urity decisions. \n\n<p>\n\nThis PhD project will develop the theory'
         b' and applications of this Compliance Budget \nLogic. The basic th'
         b'eory of the logic will be developed, followed by its application to '
         b'\nsecurity decision-making. For example, we may study how the int'
         b'eraction of multiple \nsecurity policies and multiple budgets (e.'
         b"g., users' own time, laptop battery life, etc.) \nmay be describe"
         b'd and analysed via our logic. Some of this work will be carried out '
         b'in \ncollaboration with leading security researchers at Universit'
         b'y College London. \n\n<p>\n\nAnticipated start date: 2 October 2017.'

         b'n outstandingly \nsuccessful intellectual enterprise, enabling th'
         b'e modern world. As the operations of the world \nbecome more and '
         b'more dependent on highly interconnected, massively complex, networke'
         b'd systems \nof computational devices, the need to develop a mathe'

         b'reasingly pressing. \n\n<p>\n\nOur approach, described in this monog'

         b' \n--- using techniques from algebra, computation theory, logic, '
         b'and probability theory --- with the \ncontrol of level of abstrac'
         b'tion afforded by the classical mathematical modelling method. \n\n'

         b'e approach to systems modelling \nthat is developed in the monogr'

         b'd \nintroductions to the technical development. The remaining cha'
         b'pters develop the mathematical \nand computational aspects of our'
         b' approach. Each chapter develops a specific mathematical or \ncom'
         b'putational component, clearly integrated into the overall developmen'
         b't. Examples, including \nones based on industrial and commercial '

         b'ge of areas of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science, '
         b'\nincluding type theory and logical frameworks, proof theory, cat'
         b'egorical logic, substructural \nlogic, resource semantics, and pr'
         b'ocess algebra. In theses areas, I have always been \nparticularly'
         b' interested in the interplay between syntax and semantics.  \n\n<p'
         b'>\n\nIn recent years, I have become engaged with mathematical syst'
         b'ems modelling, with a \nparticular interest in applying --- in th'
         b'e style of classical mathematical modelling as \npractised in, fo'
         b'r example, engineering, where the control of complexity by abstracti'
         b'on \nis critically important in delivering useful models --- the '
         b'ideas of compositional semantics \nand logic to  complex systems,'
         b' particularly in the social sciences and systems engineering. \nC'
         b'omputer security, system security, and information security provide '
         b'excellent challenges \nfor this approach. All this began around 2'
         b'004, with an extended \nstay with the security research group at '
         b'HP Labs, initially funded by a Royal Society \nIndustry Fellowshi'
         b'p. \n<p>\n\nMy interests in security are primarily concerned with q'
         b'uestions of policy and the interaction \nbetween policy and syste'
         b'm architecture, with a particular perspective \nprovided by econo'
         b'mics. I am also interest in logical approaches to access control pol'
         b'icy \nin which the interplay between policy architecture and syst'
         b'em architecture is considered \nexplicitly. \n\n<p>\n\nI also hav'
         b'e interests in the security of critical national infrastructure, par'
         b'ticularly \nfrom the perspective of security economics. \n\n<p>'
         b'\n\nMy research interests can be usefully organized into three gro'
         b'ups. \n\n<ul>\n\n<li> <b>Security, security management, and the econ'
         b'omics of information security and \ninformation ecosystems</b> is'
         b' concerned with conceptual, economic, and mathematical \nmodellin'
         b'g of the incentives, costs, and values of information security polic'
         b'ies, processes, \nand technologies. As such, it requires, social,'
         b' economic, cognitive, and technological \nquestions to be address'
         b'ed and integrated.  \n<p>\nThe following are currently key topics '
         b'for my research: \n<ul>\n<li> conceptual and mathematical models o'
         b'f security architectures;\n<li> security policy and security mana'
         b'gement; \n<li> information stewardship, a notion that extends cor'
         b'e \nsecurity concepts to address issues such as sustainability an'
         b'd resilience, and which is \ngiven sharp focus by the development'
         b' of, for example, cloud-based services ecosystems and \nother com'
         b'plex systems of information flows; \n<li> information stewardship'
         b' economics; \n<li> utility- and logic-based models of trust in sy'
         b'stems models; and \n<li> dynamic modelling and game-theoretic mod'
         b'elling of attack--defence postures.\n</ul>\n<p>\n<li> <b>Logic</b> '
         b'may be seen as the study of the structure and communication of infor'
         b'mation, and  \nlogicians study reasoning about the structure and '
         b'communication of information, and its formal \nrepresentation. Ma'
         b'thematicians study abstract structure and the modelling of conceptua'
         b'l and physical \nsystems.  Computer engineers study and build sys'
         b'tems that are able to represent models of conceptual \nand physic'
         b'al systems and which are able to communicate with other systems. Phi'
         b'losophers study the \nnature of ideas, of language, of entities, '
         b'and of artefacts. My research involves something of all these things'
         b', and includes \nideas from semantics/model theory, proof theory,'
