         b'ers-at-recsys-2008/">RecSys conference</a>. The post contains a reco'
         b'rding of the question/answer time at the <a href="http://recsys.acm.'
         b'org/doctoral.html">RecSys doctoral symposium</a> (which I unfortunat'
         b'ely did not attend). The clearest voice in the recording is Prof. Jo'
         b'seph Konstan, who (obviously, I know) has some very interesting thin'
         b'gs to say about collaborative filtering, recommender system research'
         b', and the state of the field. Here are some notes that I jotted down'
         b' while I was listening:<span id="more-393"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>'
         b'<a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2008/11/27/a-pitch-on-future-re'
         b'commender-systems/">As before</a>, <strong>what is a recommender sys'
         b'tem</strong>? A personalised system for people who have an excess of'
         b' choice, or more alternatives than can be manually reviewed. In term'
         b's of research, there are overlaps with HCI, psychology, user modelin'
         b'g, AI, data mining, web services, knowledge management: in fact, the'
         b're is more overlap than true centre in the field. Prof Konstan recom'
         b'mends the book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nudge-Improvi'
         b'ng-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233">Nudge</a>,&#8221; that '
         b'looks at how to design the choices that somebody sees so that they m'
         b'ake choices they are happier with, which may capture the spirit of w'
         b'hat recommender systems aim to achieve.</li>\n<li>The <strong>nam'
         b'e &#8220;recommender system&#8221;</strong> was first proposed at a '
         b'workshop on collaborative filtering; this is why there is an obvious'
         b' bias toward collaborative filtering in the literature. Prof Konstan'
         b' also makes an interesting point related to the structure of researc'
         b'h institutions: the risk and time investment required to do somethin'
         b'g new and different makes it easy to keep pushing forward what has a'
         b'lready been done (i.e. twisting an algorithm to be 0.001 better than'
         b' the last one, rather than exploring other means of recommendation).'
         b'</li>\n<li>The <strong>initial view of collaborative filtering</s'
         b'trong> was that well defined user models were not needed- statistics'
         b' and good machine learning methods would take care of the implicit r'
         b'elations in the data. We don&#8217;t need to know about our users, j'
         b'ust about their preferences. However, it is not clear that statistic'
         b's can and will outperform user modeling in all situations, especiall'
         b'y given that we will never have perfect/infinite information about a'
         b'll users in the system.</li>\n<li>Evaluating recommender systems:'
         b' the question is <strong>&#8220;what measure should we be optimising'
         b' toward?&#8221;</strong> This was discussed in a <a href="http://mob'
         b'blog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2008/11/21/do-online-reviews-really-matter/">previ'
         b'ous post</a>; and here there are mentions of the confidence in seein'
         b'g the best alternatives, optimising for diversity, and optimising fo'
         b'r user experience. Prof Konstan cites some very interesting research'
         b' he was involved in, where they measured the difference between pred'
         b'iction error and user experience. In their work, a difference of 0.3'
         b' stars between predictions/actual ratings was invisible to the user.'
         b'\xc2\xa0 We need to move away from improving prediction accuracy a'
         b'nd fine-tuning our algorithms to suit particular environments and to'
         b'ward more interesting problems: dealing with less data, measuring qu'
         b'ality difference, diversity, serendipity, confidence. Someone asks h'
         b'ow they can show that their new method will make companies more mone'
         b'y? Short answer: you can&#8217;t, but you can show how previous adva'
         b'nces in this research have directly translated to revenue increases '
         b'in companies.</li>\n<li>The best way to learn about the above is '
         b'to <strong>study real applications and systems</strong>.\xc2\xa0 C'
         b'an we study non-movie ratings? This way we will be able to find out '
         b'where generalisations of previous work are wrong and revisit old app'
         b'roaches in new contexts. The lack of data is the main obstacle to th'
         b'is- perhaps this reinforces the strong relationship RecSys wants to '
         b'keep building with both industrial and startup companies working in '
         b'this area.</li>\n<li>One example of a different domain is recomme'
         b'ndations that have a <strong>time-dependency</strong>, both from the'
         b' perspective of time-dependent items (news) and development-dependen'
         b't items (such as recommending to wine as the users learn about it). '
         b'These systems need to be able to predict changes in preferences, and'
         b' react to patterns of change. I found this interesting as it reflect'
         b's the implicit feedback loop in recommender systems (and more generi'
         b'c decision support systems) that is often not considered.</li>\n<'
         b'li>The <strong>&#8220;small recommender&#8221; problem</strong>.'
         b'\xc2\xa0 In the cases where very little data is available, process'
         b'ing it via algorithmic methods may not be the most suitable approach'
         b'. Why not visualise it somehow, or get more data from other sources?'
         b' Prof Konstan discusses buying datasets, releasing recommender syste'
         b'ms after they have been calibrated with initial data, and getting kn'
         b'owledge of how the field and users work.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\t\t\t'
