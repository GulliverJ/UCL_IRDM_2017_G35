Here, two new intelligences are spliced \r    into the social space at times mimicking and at times departing from the behaviours \r    of the passerby. </p>\r  <p>Crossings takes place within a social space of the navigation of a given \r    public space (e.g. the crossing of a street). Two new intelligences are introduced \r    into this space: the performer and an intelligent environment. Taking point \r    of departure in the given behaviour of the space, the two intelligences seek \r    to evolve their own strategies for transgressing/inhabiting the space of navigation. \r  </p>\r  <p>Crossings questions the evolution of behaviours, taking into account their \r    inherent social identity and sitedness. Learning from the early work of Carl \r    Simms, the work seeks to develop means of thinking rule based behaviour and \r    the emergence of pattern, identity and intelligence. </p>\r  <h2>Key terms for Crossings:</h2>\r  <ul>\r    <li>Non-hierarchical performance structures</li>\r    <li> Performers matching behaviours of audience</li>\r    <li> Subjects position: post human condition: intersubjectivty / intercorporeality \r      (Matching / extending / copying / replicating</li>\r    <li> Heightening awareness (Defamiliarising: deterritorialisation)</li>\r    <li> Heterotopic space / Utopic space / heterogenic space</li>\r    <li> Event space: other models for space than subject / object space</li>\r    <li> Mirror &#8211; the place you are where you are not</li>\r    <li> Mixed space of history (reiterative space, recombinant space)</li>\r  </ul>\r  <h3><img src="research/images/part11.jpg" width="450" height="168"></h3>\r  <h2>Development strategy</h2>\r  <p>The project will be started through an initial workshop setting up a simple \r    rule based system with a top mounted camera interface and top down projection. \r    The workshop is seen as a venue for developing the research question. By bringing \r    together the research partners (architecture, choreography and programming) \r    the workshop aims to question the basis of the project and develop the further \r    research goals.</p>\r  <p><img src="research/images/mapping.jpg" width="450" height="482"></p>\r  <h2>Visualisation </h2>\r  <p>In the first stage the environment is envisaged as a simple swarm informed \r    by rules determining the behaviour of spline based shapes. In the workshop \r    the environment will be explored in 2D allowing us to imagine the splines \r    as lines in 2D.</p>\r  <p>The swarm has a set departure and goal (either side of the crossing) and \r    negotiates the presence of the passerbys by seeking to avoid colliding with \r    them. Learning from non-linear dynamic systems, the swarm will be visualised \r    as a set of nurb based surfaces drawn in time (tracing their past movement). \r    As in the visualisation of turbulence the aim of the visualisation is to explore \r    how the simple rules informing the movement of the surfaces will inform the \r    parameters of speed (fast, stopping, slow) and curvature (degree and self \r    curvature). </p>\r  <h2>Programming: </h2>\r  <p>The digital environment of Crossings is initially conceived as swarm system \r    where the emergent behaviour of the whole is a result of simple rules defining \r    the behaviour of an ecology of inhabitants. </p>\r  <p>In the second stage of the project it is intended that the environment will \r    be intelligent and evolving. Based on a genetic algorithm, the environment \r    will be determined by a fitness function judging the success of each crossing \r    surface. Surfaces deemed to be successful (by means of the parameters of speed \r    and linearity) will spawn new surface while unsuccessful surfaces will be \r    terminated.<br>\r    The role of the performers: performer as virus<br>\r    A first imagination of the role of the performers is as a knowing participant \r    bridging the behaviours of the passerby (and therefore the social space) and \r    the intelligent environment. The performers will be conceived as an interruption \r    to the system, a virus that intersects with the environments learning of new \r    behaviours. As the environment learns to engage with the (and therefore successfully \r    traverse the space of the crossing), the performers become a means of interrupting \r    this learning curve, unsettling the environment and creating new criteria \r    for the intelligent environment. </p>\r  <h2>Interface </h2>\r  <p>The prototype will employ a camera interface tracking user motion in a set \r    space following the linear structure of a crossing. The camera is top mounted \r    tracking the movement of users in plan. Here, the parameters of interaction \r    will be direction and speed (velocity). </p>\r  <p>In the second stage a more robust system will be developed. Learning from \r    Bill Seaman&#8217;s dance collaboration Inversions the possibility of a infrared \r    laser beam system will be explored (question is how to draw behaviour from \r    field of space).</p>\r  <h2>Display: </h2>\r  <p>In the initial workshop the environment will be projected as a top down projection \r    in 2D. For the second stage a series of screens are imagined. These screens \r    will be position in the space of the performance but excluded from the &#8216;view&#8217; \r    of the intelligent environment. </p>\r  <p>Further ideas could be the use of handheld PDA displays distributed amongst \r    the audience or notions of an embedded display. A third solution to be explored \r    is the idea of a top down projection on the hanging piences (learning from \r    Susan Hiller&#8217;s microphone piece / top down projection)</p>\r  <h2>Audio:</h2>\r  <p>Crossings will involve the development of an interactive sound dimension. \r    Here questions of amplifcation and re-sonitication will become key terms. \r  </p>\r  <ul>\r    <li> How does wound support interactivity (both as interface and display)?</li>\r    <li> Can users conversations or utterances be used as a sonic space (whispering, \r      murmuring) </li>\r  </ul>\r  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>\r  <h2>References: </h2>\r  <ul>\r    <li>Carl Simms: Creatures</li>\r    <li> Seiko Mikami: Gravicells</li>\r    <li> Bill Seaman: Inversions</li>\r    <li> Carol Brown: Parc Guell installation </li>\r  </ul>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r</div>\r<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; left:95px; top:270px; width:175px; height:200px; z-index:3"> \r  <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">\r    <tr> \r      <td><h1 align="right">Crossings </h1>\r        <p align="right"><a href="crossings.html">Idea </a></p>\r        <p align="right">First workshop: Roehampton University 21/02.05<br>\r          <a href="crossings_para.html"> - preparations</a><br>\r          <a href="crossings_wrkshp1.html">-stills</a><br>\r          <a href="crossings_wrkshp1_cs.html">- contactsheets<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_vis1.html">- visualisation ideas<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_seaweed.html">- graphical seaweeds<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_seaweed_ani.html">-seaweed animation<br>\r          </a><a href="crossings_meshdesign.html">- mesh designs</a></p>\r        <p align="right"><a href="crossings_vis2.html">- new visualisation</a><br>\r          <a href="crossings_mesh_logic.html">- mesh coding logic</a><br>\r        </p>\r        <p align="right">Second workshop: The Place<br>\r          April 05<br>\r          <a href="crossings_wrkshp2.html">- stills </a></p>\r        <p align="right"><a href="crossings_fabrica.html">Fabrica submission</a></p></td>\r    </tr>\r  </table>\r  <h1>&nbsp;</h1>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r</div>\r</body>\r</html>\r',
