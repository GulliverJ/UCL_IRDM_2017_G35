         b'h2>Teachers notes:</h2>\n\n        <p>\n            We attempted to'
         b' follow the competitive model of teaching, and so we stuck to relati'
         b'vely simple examples of\n            how to use\n            the d'
         b'3 library. We decided that the best method of teaching would to be t'
         b'o give students the tools to be\n            creative, and\n      '
         b'      then to give them the least hand holding. The lessons err on t'
         b'he side of underexplaining in order to\n            encourage stu'
         b'dents\n            to think for themselves and collaborate, in th'
         b'e hopes they create something truly spectacular!</p>\n\n        <p'
         b'>\n            Included with these files are all the materials ne'
         b'eded to get started with d3, as well as some simple JS and\n     '
         b'       the\n            bootstrap framework. If you want to repur'
         b'pose the final project so that students make a website or\n      '
         b'      portfolio, then\n            all the tools to do so are inc'
         b'luded here!\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Apart from thi'
         b's, the previous notes still hold true, and we encourage setting up s'
         b'tudents with a VM dev\n            environment\n            or vag'
         b'rant setup so that they can experiment in a safe, disposable environ'
         b'ment. Best of luck, and we hope\n            students\n           '
         b' enjoy the course!\n\n        </p>\n\n        <strong><p>Author : Be'
