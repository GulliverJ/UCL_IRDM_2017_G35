         b'tributed Environments\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nIn this talk I will prese'
         b'nt a metamodel for access control that takes into\r\naccount the r'
         b'equirements of distributed environments, where\r\nresources and ac'
         b'cess control policies may be distributed across\r\nseveral sites. '
         b'This distributed metamodel is an extension of the\r\ncategory-base'
         b'd metamodel, from which standard centralised access\r\ncontrol mod'
         b'els such as  MAC, DAC, RBAC, Bell-Lapadula, can be derived.\r\nWe '
         b'will use term rewriting to give an operational semantics to the\r'
         b'\ndistributed metamodel, and then show how various distributed\r\na'
         b'ccess control models can be derived as instances. ',
