         b'lies goal-oriented requirements modelling to the design and analysis'
         b' of programmable DNA nanotechnology. This is part of the fascinating'
         b' field of <a title="UCL synthetic biology group" href="http://www.uc'
         b'l.ac.uk/synbion">synthetic biology</a>; the idea that we could engin'
         b'eer new biological systems performing useful functions that can\xe2'
         b'\x80\x99t be performed by natural biological systems, much in the '
         b'same way that material engineers have developed new materials such a'
         b'lloys or reinforced concrete that exhibit properties that could not '
         b'be found in natural metals and stones. These biological systems are '
         b'composed of huge numbers of nanoscale living organisms that when put'
         b' together have some global emergent properties and behaviours. The i'
         b'ndividual organisms are designed by programming their DNA, long sequ'
         b'ences of A-T-C-G letters, which is the equivalent of machine languag'
         b'e instructions for a computer program. In fact, this period in the d'
         b'evelopment of synthetic biology is often compared to the early days '
         b'of computer science, with plenty of stories and scares about people '
         b'hacking systems in their garage. That\xe2\x80\x99s about how much'
         b' I understand about it at the moment.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, soft'
         b'ware engineering concepts appear to play a significant role in the d'
         b'evelopment of this field. This <a title="Adventures in Synthetic Bio'
         b'logy" href="http://openwetware.org/wiki/Adventures">comic</a> publis'
         b'hed in Nature, for example, refers to concepts such as abstraction, '
         b'information hiding, and interfaces that are at the heart of software'
         b' architecture. The research appears to still be laying out the basic'
         b' technological foundations and, apart from important general concern'
         b's about safety and security, there doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be '
         b'much explicit consideration for requirements and the relations betwe'
         b'en requirements and architectures for such systems. As the technolog'
         b'y progresses, this will certainly change. The paper by Robyn Lutz an'
         b'd her colleagues is probably the first to investigate what requireme'
         b'nts engineering methods for such systems might look like. The paper '
         b'will be presented at the New Idea and Emerging Research track at <a '
         b'href="http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/icse2012/">ICSE</a> this week. It is one'

         b'</p>\n<p>The incident from last June was the second such death at'
         b' the hospital involving a patient connected to a monitor in a six-mo'
         b'nth period. The first, along with two earlier deaths at a Denver VA '
         b'hospital, raised questions about nursing competency in the VA system'
         b', ProPublica reported last month.</p>\n<p>The deaths also prompte'
         b'd a broader review of skills and training of VA nurses. Only half of'
         b' 29 VA facilities surveyed by the inspector general in a recent repo'
         b'rt had adequately documented that their nurses had skills to perform'
         b' their duties. Even though some nurses &#8220;did not demonstrate co'
         b'mpetency in one or more required skills,&#8221; the government repor'
         b't stated, there was no evidence of retraining. &#8230;</p>\n<p><a'

         b'the solution to prevent this from happening again is better nurse tr'
         b'aining. But is this the only way to look at this problem? Blaming th'
         b'e operator is a common reaction when this sort of incidents occur, b'
         b'ut very often the operator\xe2\x80\x99s error is caused or made m'
         b'ore likely by poor decisions in the system design.</p>\n<p>Being '
         b'curious, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a quick look at the <a href="http://'
         b'www.propublica.org/documents/item/356534-vaoig-nyc1.html">more detai'
         b'led report</a> on these incidents, and this is how it describes the '
         b'different kinds of\xc2\xa0 alarm in this system:</p>\n<blockquote><'

         b'/p></blockquote>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you all see what the prob'
         b'lem might have been; having similar alarms for possibly critical and'
         b' non-critical events is probably not a good idea.</p>\n<p>This in'
         b'cident provides a good example to illustrate the technique of<a href'
         b'="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/e.letier/publications/TSE-Obstacles.'
         b'pdf"> goal-oriented obstacle analysis</a>.</p>\n<p>An obstacle is'
         b' something that could go wrong and prevent a system from satisfying '
         b'its goals. Here, the system designers had identified that the obstac'
         b'le &#8220;Patient is accidentally disconnected from the monitor&#822'
         b'1; would obstruct the goal &#8220;Maintain Accurate Measures of Pati'
         b'ent Vital Signs&#8221; which itself contribute, along many other goa'
         b'ls, to the goal &#8220;Keep Patient Alive&#8221;. The resolution of '
         b'that obstacle was to include an alarm to warn the nurses when this h'
         b'appens (technically, in our framework we would call this an obstacle'
         b' mitigation).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, they may not have paid enoug'
         b'h attention to the goal that this obstacle resolution was meant to a'
         b'chieve. The goal is not just to send an alarm when the patient gets '
         b'disconnected (which technically, in our jargon, we would call a weak'
         b' mitigation), it is to get the nurses to react, reconnect the patien'
         b't and keep him alive (what we would call a strong mitigation). To ac'
         b'hieve this latter goal, the system relies on the assumption that nur'
         b'ses will react to the disconnection alarm. This assumption itself ha'
         b's an obstacle \xe2\x80\x9cNurse Does Not React to Disconnection A'
         b'larm\xe2\x80\x9d, which is even more likely to happen if the crit'
         b'ical disconnection alarm is similar to another non-critical alarm. I'
         b't is this obstacle that probably had not received sufficient attenti'
         b'on or wasn&#8217;t even considered during the system design and led '
         b'to the incidents. The resolution that is being proposed now is \xe2'
         b'\x80\x9cGive the nurses better training\xe2\x80\x9d (an instance of'
         b' obstacle reduction in our framework). But an alternative resolution'
         b', that could have been chosen at design time, would of course have b'
         b'een to make the &#8220;blue alarm&#8221; signalling an instrument ma'
         b'lfunction sound similar to the critical &#8220;red alarm&#8221; rath'
         b'er than to the non-critical yellow one.</p>\n<p>The techniques of'
         b' goal-oriented obstacle analysis provides a modelling and analysis f'
         b'ramework to carry out this kind of reasoning in a systematic and rig'
         b'orous way. You can check <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/e.le'

         b'g wrong requirements. Good requirements engineering can limit these '
         b'risks but they can never be entirely eliminated. Requirements must t'
         b'herefore be <em>good enough</em> so that the remaining risks are acc'
         b'eptable to the project.</p>\n<p>But how do we decide when the req'
         b'uirements are good enough and their risks acceptable?</p>\n<p>In '
         b'our paper on \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/con'
         b'tent/n542231108g17114/">Early Failure Predictions in Feature Request'
         b' Management Systems</a>\xe2\x80\x9d, we\xe2\x80\x99ve experimented'
         b' with one approach to address this question. The context for this ex'
         b'periment are large-scale open source projects, such as Firefox, Thun'
         b'derbird and four others, where features are regularly added, modifie'
         b'd, and removed \xc2\xa0in response to stakeholders\xe2\x80\x99 chan'
         b'ge requests that are submitted and discussed online. Our idea was to'
         b' apply machine learning on past change requests to build predictive '
         b'models that would give early warnings of risks associated to new cha'
         b'nge requests. Camilo Fitzgerald, the lead author of the paper, has d'
         b'eveloped an automated technique that gives early warnings about the '
         b'following risks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Product failure</strong>: '
         b'the risk that there will be bug reports or change requests associate'
         b'd with the implementation of a change request;</li>\n<li><strong>'
         b'Abandoned development</strong>: the risk that the implementation of '
         b'a change request will be abandoned before completion;</li>\n<li><'
         b'strong>Late development</strong>: the risk that the implementation o'
         b'f a change request will not be completed in time;</li>\n<li><stro'
         b'ng>Removed Feature</strong>: the risk that the implementation of a c'
         b'hange request will have to be removed from the product (typically be'
         b'cause it conflicts with other features or requirements);</li>\n<l'
         b'i><strong>Rejection Reversal</strong>: the risk that a decision to r'
         b'eject a change request is premature and will have to be reverted.</l'
         b'i>\n</ul>\n<p>The risk warnings are generated by analysing a serie'
         b's of simple characteristics in the discussion associated with the ch'
         b'ange requests such as the number of persons who participated in the '
         b'discussion, the length of the discussion, and an analysis of the wor'
         b'ds being used.</p>\n<p>The predictive model is coupled with a sim'
         b'ple model of the likely cost and benefit of performing additional re'
         b'quirements analysis on a change request before its implementation. T'
         b'he model takes into account the relative cost of additional requirem'
         b'ents analysis with respect to the cost of the failure associated to '
         b'the risk, and the probability that such additional requirements anal'
         b'ysis is actually successful at preventing failure (currently, these '
         b'factors are estimated based on general empirical data and best judge'
         b'ment rather than calibrated with project-specific data). This cost-b'
         b'enefit model is used for deciding the threshold at which to generate'
         b' the risks warnings and recommend that further requirements analysis'
         b' take place on a change request before deciding on its implementatio'
         b'n or not.</p>\n<p>The results of this experiment are promising; t'
         b'hey show that the approach is effective at discovering which change '
         b'requests have the highest risks of failure later on in development. '
         b'This information can be useful for project managers and requirements'
         b' engineers to decide whether more analysis is needed on a change req'
         b'uest before assigning it for implementation, and to monitor the deve'
         b'lopment of changes requests that have the highest risks more careful'
         b'ly.</p>\n<p>But this was really a first step. Accuracy of the ris'
         b'k warnings might be improved in several ways, for example by applyin'
         b'g more sophisticated natural language techniques for automatically d'
         b'etecting ambiguities in change requests, or by taking into account c'
         b'haracteristics of the software components affected by a change reque'
         b'st. These improvements might also give us better explanations about '
         b'<em>why</em> a change request has a specific risk. One of the bigges'
         b't limitations of our current technique is that it identifies correla'
         b'tions between change requests and failure, but it does not give us u'
         b'seful explanations about why some change request characteristics lea'
         b'd to a certain type of failures. Much better models will be needed f'
         b'or this approach to be really useful.</p>\n<p>It would also be in'
         b'teresting to try this approach in other contexts than online change '
         b'request management systems.</p>\n<p>It could for example be appli'
         b'ed to traditional<strong> requirements documents. </strong>All we ne'
         b'ed is to be able to relate individual requirements items to their ou'
         b'tcomes (e.g. how long they take to implement, whether they have asso'
         b'ciated bug reports and change requests, etc.) and we would be able t'
         b'o apply the same machine learning techniques to construct similar pr'
         b'edictive models.</p>\n<p>It would also be interesting to apply it'
         b' in the context of <strong>agile development</strong>. In this conte'
         b'xt, the approach could be viewed as a form of extensive automated re'
         b'trospective analysis.\xc2\xa0 It would consists in automatically a'
         b'nalyzing all data and meta-data associated with epics, users stories'
         b', acceptance tests, and their outcomes to try to learn characteristi'
         b'cs of good and bad user stories with respect to requirements risks.<'
         b'/p>\n<p>The long term objective of this work is to make requireme'
         b'nts risks much more visible and central to software development than'
         b' they are today. Instead of viewing requirements primarily as docume'
         b'ntation, we should give more importance their role as risk mitigatio'
         b'n tools, and develop the techniques that treat them as such.</p>'

         b'quote><p>According to Harold Bloom&#8217;s theory of creativity, out'
         b'lined in books like The Anxiety of Influence and A Map of Misreading'
         b', a &#8216;strong&#8217; poet is one who&#8217;s heavily influenced '
         b'by a predecessor but who resists that influence, fights it with ever'
         b'y ounce of its strength. In Bloom&#8217;s Freudian-mystical account,'
         b' the resulting Oedipal struggle entails the younger poet (who will h'
         b'ave been initiated, turned on to the glory of poetry by a primal enc'
         b'ounter with the elder&#8217;s work) swerving from the ancestor&#8217'
         b';s style, willfully misreading it or doing violence to it in some ot'
         b'her way. The strong artist is impelled by a despairing sense of bela'
         b'tedness, the feeling that nothing new can be said because the precur'
         b'sor said it all. A titanic psychological struggle to self-birth ones'
         b'elf as an artist is required before the descendant ceases to ventril'
         b'oquise the dead elder and finds his own voice. But a &#8216;weak&#82'
         b'17; poet (or painter or musician) is simply inundated, flooded by th'
         b'e ancestor&#8217;s vision.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Does this theory '
         b'about creativity applies to research? Is a strong researcher one who'
         b'&#8217;s been heavily influenced by predecessor&#8217;s work and mak'
         b'es violence to it to find his or her own voice? I believe there&#821'
         b'7;s some truth in this. I do not mean that software engineering rese'
         b'arch should be like poetry. I&#8217;m with Bertand Russell, I like <'
         b'a title="Bertrand Russell - Clarity and exact thinking" href="http:/'
         b'/www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpJcn0Otk7I">clarity and exact thinking</a>'
         b'. There are nevertheless strong parallels between creativity in rese'
         b'arch, poetry, and in fact most other kinds of creative work. All req'
         b'uire some form of obsession with your work, and an urge to explore t'
         b'he unknown and move things forward.</p>\n<p>I cannot finish this '

         b'rs ago while working on system to optimise the placement of GSM ante'
         b'nna for which he was developing UML models and Z specifications. He '
         b'used this system as example to illustrate the technique of story map'
         b'ping. He contrasted this form of &#8220;low resolution model&#8221; '
         b'&#8211;a phrase that I liked&#8211; to the more detailed UML activit'
         b'y diagrams or BPMN models one could also write for such models.<'
         b'/p>\n<p>There were lots of discussions during and after the talk '
         b'questioning some of the assumptions behind agile methods. As usual, '
         b'it is impossible to go to the bottom of things in one short evening,'
         b' but I found the event interesting in teasing out different sensibil'
         b'ities on this topic, from the young enthusiasts to the veterans '
         b'who\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it all before.</p>\n<p>One thing that w'
         b'asn\xe2\x80\x99t discussed so much during the evening is the impa'
         b'ct that these changes have on the work practices of requirements eng'
         b'ineers. This is something I&#8217;d like to come back to at some poi'
         b'nt. In the meantime, I would recommend the research done by Angela M'
         b'artin, Robert Biddle and James Noble described in their pape'
         b'r \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/r2l186'

         b'icitation, Communication and Acceptance on Agile Projects</a'
         b'>\xe2\x80\x9d. It describes the many roles requirements engineers'
         b' play in agile projects (geek interpreter, technical liaison, negoti'
         b'ator, diplomat, customer coach, super-secretary, etc.) and the diffi'
         b'culties they face in fulfilling these roles, notably in sustaining t'
         b'he pace of having to deliver quality user stories at regular interva'
         b'l while keeping constantly engaged with both developers and large nu'
         b'mbers of stakeholders in the client organisation. It also describes '
         b'some of the practices that have emerged to try overcome to these dif'
         b'ficulties, for example by having iterations where programmers work o'
         b'n technical tasks (e.g. repaying technical debt and setting up suppo'
         b'rt tools) so that it gives customers time to think ahead, organising'
         b' customers boot camps on agile processes, and having programmers wor'
         b'k as apprentices in the customer&#8217;s organisation. These are pro'
         b'bably not enough to fully resolve the workload problem for requireme'
         b'nts engineers and customers, but they can somewhat lower their impac'

         b'for Business Change</a>&#8221; at a meeting of the BCS Business Chan'
         b'ge Specialist Group last Thursday. The talk consisted purely of disc'
         b'ussions about goals, how to elaborate goal models by asking WHY and '
         b'HOW questions, how to avoid confusing goals and activities, how to i'
         b'dentify stakeholders by asking WHO questions, how to define goals wi'
         b'th measurable factors and targets, and how to anchor risks analysis '
         b'on specific goals instead of doing it in a vacuum. Every concept had'
         b' an almost direct relation to some of our research papers: <a href="'

         b'/a>.</p>\n<p>And Pelorus even brings something new and exciting t'
         b'o goal modelling. It is a lightweight tool for <em>collaborative</em'
         b'> modelling. The target domain for Pelorus is the domain of business'
         b' change initiatives. Studies show that about 50% of all such initiat'
         b'ives fail. There are many reasons for this, but one of the main fact'
         b'ors is a failure to engage key stakeholders early enough in the desi'
         b'gn of the changes. Vic quoted Rosabeth Kanter: &#8220;<em>Change is '
         b'disturbing when done to us, and exhilarating when done by us</em>&#8'
         b'220;&#8212;a view I agree with entirely. The focus in Pelorus is on '
         b'providing a platform that allows large groups of stakeholders to col'
         b'lectively define and manage their goals for a change project. Unlike'
         b' other goal modelling tools such as <a href="http://www.objectiver.c'
         b'om/index.php?id=4">Objectiver </a>or <a href="http://jucmnav.softwar'
         b'eengineering.ca/ucm/bin/view/ProjetSEG/WebHome">jUCM-Nav</a>, it is '
         b'not meant to be used for a detailed goal-oriented elaboration of com'
         b'plete software requirements specifications.</p>\n<p>Pelorus is a '
         b'web-based tool with a deliberate minimalistic design. The main conce'
         b'pt is that of goal, a goal can support other goals, goals must be we'
         b'll-defined and measurable, and&#8212;apart from a few of other thing'
         b's such as the goal-based risk analysis&#8212; that&#8217;s it. This '
         b'is goal modelling stripped to its bare minimum! Keeping it simple is'
         b' essential to allow a diverse group of stakeholders to contribute di'
         b'rectly to its elaboration, but it also ensures that everyone focuses'
         b' on the goals and noting else. This minimalistic design is reflected'
         b' in a clean and simple user interface that you can see in their <a h'
         b'ref="http://www.toolforchange.com/tour">videos</a>. Oh, maybe it&#82'
         b'17;s a detail, but in Pelorus goal models are not called models, the'
         b'y are <em><strong>maps</strong></em>. This is a term that was also u'
         b'sed by another company <a href="http://www.kinetium.com/map/demo/dem'
         b'o_index.html">selling goal-oriented techniques</a>, so there might b'
         b'e something here.</p>\n<p><span style="text-align:center; display'

         b'" /></a></span></p>\n<p>Once the goal map has been defined, Stake'
         b'holders continue to use Pelorus to supervise the delivery and harves'
         b'ting of the changes. This transforms the goal model in a form of &#8'
         b'220;living&#8221; business case that, unlike traditional business ca'
         b'ses that are written once and then forgotten, can evolve throughout '
         b'the change delivery. This is another interesting idea that resonates'
         b' with my current research interests on system evolution.<strong></st'
         b'rong></p>\n<p>Pelorus could be a good example of how research ide'
         b'as transfer to practice, except that Vic Stenning had never heard ab'
         b'out goal-oriented requirements engineering. The main influence behin'
         b'd Pelorus, he says, is <a href="http://wulrich.com/cst_brief.html">c'
         b'ritical systems thinking </a>&#8211;although, as far as I know, crit'
         b'ical systems thinking doesn&#8217;t include the kind of goal modelli'
         b'ng approach present in Pelorus. Sure enough, the concepts of goals, '
         b'goal decomposition, measurable objectives, and perhaps even obstacle'
         b's are so common that one doesn&#8217;t need to have read or heard ab'
         b'out goal modelling to come up with the same ideas. Yet, during the t'
         b'alk, the resemblances with the research papers and <a href="http://w'
         b'ww.info.ucl.ac.be/Research/Publication/2001/RE01.pdf">tutorial </a>o'
         b'n goal-oriented requirements engineering was striking. One person in'
         b' the audience observed that these ideas are very much in the air at '
         b'the moment. As a researcher who sometimes has to justify the public '
         b'money spent on his research by showing it has an impact, I like to b'
         b'elieve that we have played at least a small role in putting these id'
         b'eas in the air. I hope Pelorus and other similar tools will continue'
         b' to push these ideas forward.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t<'
