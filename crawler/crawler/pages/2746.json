         b"rrounding the notion of 'presence in virtual\r\n            enviro"
         b"nments'. (For a recent survey see IJsselsteijn et al., 2001).\r\n "
         b'           This confusion is hampering progress in the field. There '
         b'can be no\r\n            advancement simply because when people ta'

         b'erminology that\r\n            may clear up the confusion, and pre'
         b'vent arguments over essentially\r\n            non-issues. If rese'

         b" have argued before about the separation of the term 'immersion'"
         b"\r\n            from 'presence' (e.g, Slater, 1999). Let's reserve"
         b" the term\r\n            'immersion' to stand simply for what the "
         b'technology delivers from an\r\n            objective point of view'
         b'. The more that a system delivers displays\r\n            (in all '
         b'sensory modalities) and tracking that preserves fidelity in\r\n   '
         b'         relation to their equivalent real-world sensory modalities,'
         b" the more\r\n            that it is 'immersive'. This is something"

         b's to different issues than how it is\r\n            perceived by h'
         b'umans. I am making the distinction here similar to\r\n            '
         b'that in colour science. A colour can be described objectively in'
         b'\r\n            terms of a wavelength distribution. However, the p'
         b'erception of\r\n            colour is an entirely different matter'

         b'ions are perceived as the same colour by human\r\n            obse'

         b'through the analogy with\r\n            metamers, different immers'

         b"meone's quadraphonic sound system which is\r\n            playing "
         b"some music. &quot;Wow!&quot; you say &quot;that's just like\r\n   "
         b'         being in the theatre where the orchestra is playing.&quot; '
         b'That\r\n            statement is a sign of presence. You then go o'
         b'n to say &quot;But the\r\n            music is really uninterestin'
         b'g and after a few moments my mind\r\n            started to drift '
         b'and I lost interest.&quot; That second statement is <i>nothing\r\n'
         b'            to do with presence</i>. You would not conclude, because'
         b' the music\r\n            is uninteresting that you did not have t'
         b'he illusion of being in the\r\n            theatre listening to th'
         b'e orchestra. The first statement is about\r\n            form. The'
         b' second statement is about content. Presence is about form,\r\n   '
         b'         the extent to which the unification of simulated sensory da'

         b'he potential for you to act.\r\n            The second statement i'

         b'presence</i> to refer to the\r\n            statement about form: '
         b'It is just like being in a theatre (in the\r\n            example '

         b'e.g., watching a soap opera, reading a\r\n            book). &quot'
         b';Aha!&quot; you might say &quot;when I read xyz book, it\r\n      '

         b"fferent situations 'involve' people. One can also do the same in"

         b'Listening to the music you might say &quot;This is\r\n            '
         b'just like being in the theatre listening to the orchestra - but '
         b"the\r\n            music - you know - it just doesn't interest me."

         b'erceive may be emotionally\r\n            engaging or not. It does'
         b"n't change the fact of my presence. If\r\n            suddenly som"
         b'ething bad happened here (I hesitate to write an example\r\n      '
         b'      in the current international climate) I would be more emotiona'
         b'lly\r\n            engaged, but not more present. My heart would s'

         b'>It should be clear from this discussion that presence and\r\n    '
         b"        immersion are not the same. Remember that presence is a 'res"
         b"ponse'\r\n            to a system of a certain level of immersion."
         b' In order to achieve\r\n            presence we could follow two d'
         b'ifferent paths. The first is to\r\n            construct a system '
         b'that has such a high fidelity to reality that it\r\n            be'
         b'comes indistinguishable from reality. A more interesting approac'
         b'h\r\n            is to use knowledge of the perceptual system to f'
         b'ind out what is\r\n            important in our representations of'
         b' reality - to deliver presence\r\n            even when the level '
         b'of immersion is not high. People may achieve\r\n            presen'
         b'ce with wire frame computer graphics, some approximation to\r\n   '
         b'         auditory fidelity, low resolution, and so on. How does this'
         b' work?\r\n            This is the real scientific question for pre'
         b'sence. Knowing the\r\n            wavelength distribution of light'
         b' emitted from a surface informs us\r\n            something about '
         b'how it may be perceived in terms of colour, but it\r\n            '
         b'is far from the whole story. Understanding the human perceptual\r'
         b'\n            response to the wavelength distribution is critical'
         b' in understanding\r\n            colour. We know that, for example'
         b', that it is conceptually possible\r\n            to reproduce the'
         b' entire spectrum of perceivable colours (taking into\r\n          '
         b'  account metamers) just by additively combining three primaries. Th'
         b'is\r\n            latter property (reducing the function space of '
         b'wavelength\r\n            distributions to the three dimensional s'
         b'pace of perceivable colours)\r\n            is only possible becau'
         b'se of the way that human perceptual system\r\n            works. S'
         b'imilarly, our anecdotal experience of virtual reality\r\n         '
         b'   convinces us that presence can be achieved with systems that '
         b'are\r\n            extreme in their paucity compared to the incred'

         b'sumed that you shut\r\n            your eyes when listening to the'
         b' sound system. But suppose your eyes\r\n            stay&nbsp; ope'
         b'n? Then there would be&nbsp; contradictory signals in\r\n         '
         b'   the visual and auditory modalities - where is your presence? Ther'
         b'e\r\n            may be different presence in different modalities'
         b' - i.e., the\r\n            simultaneous maintenance of auditory p'
         b'resence in one situation,\r\n            visual presence in anothe'
         b'r, and kinaesthetic presence in yet\r\n            another. Or it '
         b'may be a question of field dominance - your preferred\r\n         '
         b'   sensory modality gives you overall presence according to the\r'
         b'\n            situation of that modality. (We considered these is'
         b'sues in Slater,\r\n            Usoh, Steed, 1994 and references th'
         b'erein). Or there may just be\r\n            confusion. It is likel'
         b'y that in order to achieve presence there\r\n            needs to '
         b'be consistency in sensory input across as well as within\r\n      '
