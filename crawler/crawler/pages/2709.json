         b'exceptions CS modules are worth 0.5 Course-units (15 FHEQ credits). '
         b'Typically, a CS module is taught as about 30 hours of lectures plus '
         b'tutorials, computer lab classes,&nbsp;help sessions and so on. We ex'
         b'pect that, normally, the workload for a 0.5 Course-unit (15 FHEQ cre'
         b'dit) module is about&nbsp;150 Learning hours when lectures, exercise'
         b's, coursework, reading, revision etc. are totalled. Some modules are'
         b' compulsory whilst others are chosen from a range of options. Such c'
         b'hoices must always be with the approval of the Departmental Tutor. F'

         b"tware as though they were a student's own. Any quotation from the pu"
         b'blished or unpublished works of other persons must, therefore, be cl'
         b'early identified as such by being  placed inside quotation marks, an'
         b'd students should identify their  sources as accurately and fully as'
         b' possible. A series of short  quotations from several different sour'
         b'ces, if not clearly identified as  such, constitutes plagiarism just'
         b' as much as does a single  unacknowledged long quotation from a sing'

         b' judgements, figures, software or diagrams, a reference to that pers'
         b'on in the text must be made and  the work referred to must be includ'
         b"ed in the bibliography.</li><li>  Recourse to the services of 'ghost"

         b'orts) or of outside  word-processing agencies which offer correction'
         b'/improvement of English  is strictly forbidden, and students who mak'
         b'e use of the services of such agencies render themselves liable for '
         b'an academic penalty.</li><li>Use of unacknowledged information downl'
         b'oaded from the internet also constitutes plagiarism.</li><li>Where p'
         b"art of an examination consists of 'take away'  papers, essays or oth"
         b"er work written in a student's own time, or a  coursework assessment"

         b' illicit to reproduce material which a student  has used in other wo'
         b'rk/assessment for the course or programmes  concerned. Students shou'
         b'ld be aware of this \xe2\x80\x98self-plagiarism\xe2\x80\x99. If in'
         b'  doubt, students should consult their Personal Tutor or another  ap'
         b'propriate teacher.</li><li>Failure to observe any of the provisions '
         b'of this policy or of approved departmental guidelines constitutes an'
         b' examination offence  under UCL and University Regulations. Examinat'
         b'ion offences will normally be treated as cheating or irregularities '
         b'under the Regulations in  respect of Examination Irregularities. Und'
         b'er these Regulations students  found to have committed an offence ma'
         b'y be excluded from all further  examinations of UCL or the Universit'
         b'y or of both.</li><li>The expression of original ideas is considered'
         b'  intellectual property, and is protected by copyright laws, just li'
         b'ke  original inventions. Almost all forms of expression fall under c'
         b'opyright protection as long as they are recorded in some way (such a'
         b's a book or a computer file).</li></ul><p><b>Please take this&nbsp;i'
         b'nformation very seriously.</b> There have been cases in the past in '
         b'which students have been found to have cheated by copying the work o'
         b'f other students and submitting this as their own. UCL takes an extr'
         b'emely serious view of plagiarism. Students found to have been cheati'
         b'ng may be given a mark of 0% for the work in question. In severe cas'
         b"es all of a student's results for the year can be declared void and "
         b'he/she can be sent down for a year. Persistent offenders may be perm'
         b'anently excluded from UCL. Note that, when plagiarism is discovered,'
         b' it is not normally obvious which piece of work is the original from'
         b' which the others have been copied. This means that all those involv'
         b'ed, including one possibly innocent party, come under suspicion.'
         b' \r</p>\n<p>Computer Science students are perhaps especially vulne'
         b'rable since much of the material they deal with is electronic and he'
         b'nce easy to copy. For example, if you find information or software o'
         b'n the&nbsp;internet which helps you with a piece of coursework you <'
         b'b>must</b> acknowledge your source. The acknowledgement must be prec'
         b'ise indicating exactly what was the source and which sections of you'
         b'r work are affected. If it turns out that an almost complete solutio'
         b'n to a problem is available on the internet, you should report that '
         b'fact - it is then a problem for the lecturer rather than for you! Yo'
         b"u should avoid looking at other students' solutions or allowing othe"
         b"rs to look at yours; once you have see someone else's solution it is"
         b' virtually impossible for you to erase it from your memory and produ'
         b'ce your own independent work. \r</p>\n<p>Note that we do not wish '
         b'to discourage students from discussing their work with fellow studen'
         b'ts and collaborating in solving problems. However you should avoid a'
         b'llowing the collaborative phase to approach too close to a final sol'
         b'ution which might make it impossible for you to make your own distin'
         b'ctive intellectual contribution. The key point is that you must not '
         b"present the results of another person's work &quot;as though they we"
         b're your own&quot;. <b>If you feel that a substantial part of a piece'
         b' of work you submit for assessment has resulted from collaboration w'
         b'ith other students you must make that clear in writing before the wo'
         b'rk is marked.</b>\r</p>\n<p>In order to clarify some of the issues'
         b' around collaborative working, the Departmental Teaching Committee ('
         b'DTC) agreed some guidelines, a copy of which you can read here: <a h'

         b'p; This system gives access to billions of sources, as well as work '

         b'quite unable to make progress. Do not try to solve this problem by c'
         b'opying. Instead, explain to the lecturer what has happened either in'
         b' person or in writing. Keep copies of the preliminary work you have '
         b'done (rough notes etc.) as evidence that you have tried. You will no'
         b't be declared &quot;not complete&quot; if you can show you have made'
