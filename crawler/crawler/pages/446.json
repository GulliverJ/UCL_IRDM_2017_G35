Derive the matrix that transforms a World\nCoordinate (WC) point into the \'viewing coordinate system\' (or \'eye\ncoordinate system\') specified by eye, centre and up. (Remember that\nOpenGL operates a right-handed coordinate system throughout).  \n<br>\n\n<p>\n\n1(b) Suppose that eye=(0,0,0), centre = (3,0,4) and up = (0,0,1). What coordinates in the viewing coordinate system would the WC point (0,1,2) have? \n<br>\n\n<p>\n\n1(c) The view plane is 1 unit along the positive z axis. To what point on the view plane will the WC point (0,1,2) be projected?\n<br>\n\n<p>\n\n1(d) Suppose the view plane window is between -4 and 4 in both x and y, and the display window size is 1000 by 1000 pixels. To what actual pixel will the WC point (0,1,2) be projected?\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n2. A camera is modelled as follows: the View Reference Point is at\n(-3,1,5), the camera is pointing at the centre of the cube defined by\nA,B,C,D,E,F,G,H in the following diagram, and the View Up Vector is\n(0,1,0). Where does the point A map to in camera coordinates?\n\n\n<br>\n<img src="chap7-1.gif" alt=" "><br>\n<br>\n\n\n3. (Harder, refer to Chapter 11) Calculate which faces of the cube\nA,B,C,D,E,F,G,H are visible to the camera that was defined in question\n2?\n\n<hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_7.htm">Chapter 7</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Sun Jul 20 20:53:52 BST 2003\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
