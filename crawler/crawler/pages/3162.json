         b'ref="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2007/10/31/lightweight-distributed-'
         b'trust-propagation/">good papers</a> about trust, I still find the id'
         b'ea slightly strange: is trust something that can actually be quantif'
         b'ied? Are these computers actually reasoning about <em>trust</em>? (w'
         b'hat is trust?)</p>\n<p>Trust, however, seems to have a place in o'
         b'ur research. It gives us a metaphor to describe how interactions bet'
         b'ween &#8220;strangers&#8221; should happen, a platform to build appl'
         b'ications that feed off these ideas, and a language to describe and a'
         b'nalyse the emergent properties that we observe in these systems. So,'
         b' even if a trust relationship may be a concept that cannot be boiled'
         b' down to a deterministic protocol, it gives researchers a model of t'
         b'he world they are exploring.</p>\n<p>I decided to apply this meta'
         b'phor to collaborative filtering, an algorithm that aims to generate '
         b'recommendations by assigning neighbours to each user. Usually this a'
         b'ssignment is done by computed similarity, which has its downfalls: h'
         b'ow similar are two people who have never rated items in common? What'
         b' is the <a href="http://mobblog.cs.ucl.ac.uk/2007/09/21/collaborativ'
         b'e-filtering-is-strange/">best way of measuring similarity</a>? Apply'
         b'ing the metaphor of trust, instead, aims at capturing the value that'
         b' each neighbour gives to a user&#8217;s recommendations over time, a'
         b'nd value is not only derived from agreement- but also from the abili'
         b'ty a neighbour has to provide information. While similarity-based al'
         b'gorithms use neighbour ratings, interactions based on trust acknowle'
         b'dge that information received from others is subject to interpretati'
         b'on, as there may be a strong <em>semantic distance</em> between the '
         b'way two users apply ratings to items.</p>\n<p>Trust is a richer c'
         b'oncept than similarity by favouring neighbours who can give you info'
         b'rmation about the items you seek and offering a means of learning to'
         b' interpret the information received from them. Evaluating this techn'
         b'ique improves on the basic similarity-driven algorithms, both in ter'
         b'ms of accuracy and coverage: modeling the problem as an instance of '

         b'\t\t<p>Two main interpretations are to view trust as the perceived'
         b' reliability of something or somebody, called \xe2\x80\x9creliabi'
         b'lity trust\xe2\x80\x9d, and to view trust as a decision to enter '
         b'into a situation of dependence, called \xe2\x80\x9cdecision trust'
         b'\xe2\x80\x9d. Both reliability trust and decision trust reflect a'
         b' positive belief about something on<br />\nwhich trustor depends '
         b'for his welfare. Reliability trust is most naturally measured as a d'
         b'iscrete or continuous degree of reliability, whereas decision trust '
         b'is most naturally measured in terms of a binary decision. While most'
         b' trust and reputation models assume reliability trust, decision trus'
         b't can also modelled. Systems based on decision trust models should b'
         b'e considered as decision making tools. </p>\n<p>The difficulty of'
         b' capturing the notion of trust in formal models in a meaningful way '
         b'has led some economists to reject it as a computational concept. The'
         b' strongest expression for this view has been given by Williamson (Ca'
         b'lculativeness, Trust and Economic Organization. Journal of Law and E'
         b'conomics, 36:453-486, April 1993.) who argues that the notion of tru'
         b'st should be avoided when modelling economic interactions, because i'
         b't adds nothing new, and that well studied notions such as reliabilit'
         b'y, utility and risk are adequate and sufficient for that purpose. Pe'
         b'rsonal trust is the only type of trust that can be meaningful for de'
         b'scribing interactions, according to Williamson. He argues that perso'
         b'nal trust applies to emotional and personal interactions such as lov'
         b'e relationships where mutual performance is not always monitored and'
         b' where failures are forgiven rather than sanctioned. In that sense, '
         b'traditional computational models would be inadequate e.g. because of'
         b' insuffcient data and inadequate sanctioning, but also because it wo'
         b'uld be detrimental to the relationships if the involved parties were'
         b' to take a computational approach. Non-computation models for trust '
         b'can be meaningful for studying such relationships according to Willi'
         b'amson, but developing such models should be done within the domains '
         b'of sociology and psychology, rather than in economy.</p>\n<p>In t'
         b'he light of Williamson&#8217;s view on modelling trust it becomes im'
         b'portant to judge the purpose and merit of online trust management it'
         b'self. Can trust management add anything new and valuable to the Inte'
         b'rnet technology and economy? The answer, in our opinion, is definite'
         b'ly yes. The value of trust management lies in the architectures and '
         b'mechanisms for collecting trust relevant information, for efficient,'
         b' reliable and secure processing, for distribution of derived trust a'
         b'nd reputation scores, and for taking this information into account w'
         b'hen navigating the Internet and making decisions about online activi'
         b'ties and transactions. Economic models for risk taking and decision '
         b'making are abstract and do not address how to build trust networks a'
         b'nd reputation systems. Trust management specifically addresses how t'
         b'o build such systems, and can in addition include aspects of economi'
         b'c modelling whenever relevant and useful.</p>\n<p>It can be noted'
         b' that the traditional cues of trust and reputation that we are used '
         b'to observe and depend on in the physical world are missing in online'
         b' environments. Electronic substitutes are therefore needed when desi'
         b'gning online trust and reputation<br />\nsystems. Furthermore, co'
         b'mmunicating and sharing information related to trust and reputation '
         b'is relatively difficult, and normally constrained to local communiti'
         b'es in the physical world, whereas IT systems combined with the Inter'
         b'net can be leveraged to design<br />\nextremely efficient systems'
         b' for exchanging and collecting such information on a global scale.</'
