Our particular focus is on the \r      relationship that emerges as the engagement between user and environment \r      increases in complexity over time.</p>\r    <p>In this study the user learns to interact with the environment by incorporating \r      new embodied practices (breathing and eventually GSR), the environment evolves \r      displaying new dynamic behaviours. </p>\r    <p>Using an analogy of <i>health </i><span style=\'font-style:\rnormal\'>we set up a simple feedback loop between the user\'s actions and the changing \r      complexity of the environment. The basic concept is that the healthier the \r      system is, the more complex it becomes. The body\'s Hear Rate Control teaches \r      us that complexity of the system is a sign of </span><i>health</i><span\rstyle=\'font-style:normal\'>, allowing the body to adapt to new conditions. As we \r      get older, or with illness, the complexity of the system decreases thereby \r      becoming less able to adapt to environmental and bodily changes. </span></p>\r    <p><i>\'When physiologic systems become less complex, their </i><em><span style=\'font-style:normal\'>information \r      content</span></em><i> is degraded. As a result, they are less adaptable \r      and less able to cope with the exigencies of a constantly changing environment. \r      To generate information, a system must be capable of behaving in an unpredictable \r      fashion. In contrast, a highly predictable, regular output (i.e., a sine \r      wave) is information-poor since it monotonously repeats its activity. (The \r      most extreme example of complexity loss would be the total absence of variability \r      - a straightline output.)<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span\rclass=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>\' </i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'>[Goldberger \r      xx]</span></p>\r    <p>The study seeks to explore a continuum of complexity. Complexity spans \r      from order (no complexity) to chaos (high complexity). The emergence of \r      <i>interesting behaviours</i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'> takes place \r      at the </span><i>edge of chaos</i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'>, a boundary \r      where complex patterning arises. Langton describes the passing through the \r      edge of chaos as a </span><i>phase shift</i><span style=\'font-style:\rnormal\'>, a transition from one </span><i>regime </i><span style=\'font-style:\rnormal\'>to another. Moving from order through the edge of chaos, the system changes \r      dramatically in its visual and behavioural properties. </span></p>\r    <p><img src="research/images/p4_6.jpg" width="450" height="180"></p>\r    <h2>2) Research questions and hypothesis</h2>\r    <p><b><i>Research question: <br>\r      </i></b><span style=\'font-weight:normal\'><i>Does presence increase when \r      the environment is directly generated by your actions<a href="#_ftn2"\rname="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>?</i></span></p>\r    <p><span style=\'font-family:"GillSans BoldItalic"\'>Hypothesis: </span><br>\r      <i>The user\'s sense of presence vary with their sense of agency and control \r      over the environment<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span\rclass=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>.</i></p>\r    <h2>3) Design</h2>\r    <p>The environment is conceived as a complex system of particles that follow \r      low-level rule-based behaviours. Taking inspiration from Craig Reynolds\'s \r      \'Boids\' these behaviours will be simple and based on an idea of local spaces \r      (neighbourhoods) generating emergent behaviours in the overall environment \r      (for example through <i>separation</i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'>, \r      </span><i>cohesion</i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'> and </span><i>alignment<a\rhref="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a>). \r      </i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'>The environment can be seen as a cloud \r      of voxels continually morphing the properties of colour, location, size, \r      density, transparency and direction. Like a magnetic field it is distribution \r      of alignments merging and flexing in time, responding to the forces that \r      act on it<a\rhref="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[5]</span></a>. \r      </span></p>\r    <p>\r      <embed src="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/mthomsen/www/images/composite_coloured.mov" width="450" height="420"></embed></p>\r    <p>The user engages with the environment through a variety of interactions, \r      at different levels of awareness. Employing the body centred interface, \r      the user interacts through breathing, heart rate and gsr as well as simple \r      user position (x,y,z) gained from the CAVE tracker. </p>\r    <p>The parameters for the rule based behaviours are determined from the incoming \r      data from the body sensors. For instance breathing frequency might control \r      the parameter of <i>cohesion </i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'>for each \r      individual particle (steer to move toward the \r      average position of local particles). This would create a more or less dense \r      space varying as the users breathing is sped up or slowed down. As the environment \r      increases in complexity the inputs are mapped onto more interactive parameters \r      (e.g. colour and sound). </span></p>\r    <h3>Description of how relationship between user and environment unfolds through \r      the course of the experience</h3>\r    <p>The system is described as a dynamic feedback loop between user and environment. \r      Each phase is described by a transition in the users learning curve matched \r      by the increased health of the system. This is expressed through the adding \r      of dynamic properties (movement, colour, sound) within each phase. </p>\r    <p>The user learns to interact with the environment recognising the patterning \r      in the particles\' behaviour. As the system increases in <i>health </i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'>(complexity) \r      particles\' behaviour starts to change, in turn becoming less predictable. \r      This lack of predictability means that the user begins to lose control and \r      starts to question their agency and role within the environment. This leads \r      to a withdrawal<a href="#_ftn6"\rname="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[6]</span></a> of interaction \r      which in turn initiates a regression of the feedback loop returning the \r      environment to a less healthy state, and therefore to higher levels of predictability. \r      </span></p>\r    <h4>Phase 1: dormant</h4>\r    <p>The user enters the CAVE and sees a curtain made up of gray scale particles. \r      The particles are dormant but have the potential for change, when the user \r      interacts with them. As the user approaches, the particles sense her proximity \r      and start to surround her in a non-threatening, \'open\' way. </p>\r    <h4>Phase 2: movement </h4>\r    <p>Having surrounded the user in a cloud formation, the particles <i>listen</i><span style=\'font-style:normal\'> \r      for the inputs that will help them grow. These inputs are breathing, heart \r      rate and gsr and position. As they receive these inputs, they begin to dynamically \r      change their size and initiate flocking behaviour. For instance the size \r      of particles can reflect respiration (e.g. quicker&amp;shallower breathing \r      translates to larger particles), and density can be set by heart rate (e.g. \r      higher heart rate will cause particles to congregate more closely). </span></p>\r    <p>With time the user becomes aware of a certain pattern in the environment\'s \r      responses, and starts to initiate more \'deliberate\' forms of interaction: \r      for example, by breathing more deeply, or quickly. Continued interaction \r      from the user increases the <i>health</i><span style=\'font-style:\rnormal\'> and therefore complexity of the environment until it reaches a level \r      of \'optimal health\', it is ready to the leap in complexity from the current \r      level (phase 2) to the next level (phase 3). </span></p>\r    <h4>Phase 3: colour<span style=\'font-size:13.0pt;font-family:Helvetica\'><b> \r      </b></span></h4>\r    <p>In the third phase the particle cloud \'listens\' for input, this time allowing \r      the user to interact with the property of colour as well as size and location. \r      For example hue can reflect respiration (e.g. quicker&amp;shallower breathing \r      translates to red/orange whereas slower&amp;deeper breathing translates \r      to blue/purple); shade can be set by heart rate (e.g. higher heart rate \r      will result in lighter particles like pink/peach, and slower heart rate \r      in darker shades like magenta/orange). </p>\r    <p>The input to the system remains the same as in phase 2 but adds the interactive \r      parameter of colour.</p>\r    <h4>Phase 4: Fourth regime: sound </h4>\r    <p>The fourth phase adds the dimension of sound. Again the user can interact \r      with the environment using the parameters of size, location (phase 2) and \r      colour (phase 3) while also engaging with a sound dimension generating shifts \r      in pitch and rhythm. </p>\r    <h2>4) Methodology:</h2>\r    <p><span style=\'font-family:"GillSans BoldItalic"\'>Task </span><br>\r      The users are asked to explore the environment with their actions.
