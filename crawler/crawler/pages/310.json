         b'epresents more than 20% or more of the overall module assessment a t'
         b'hreshold for completion, such as a requirement to submit at least a '
         b'specified fraction of the coursework, must be set by the department '
         b'and clearly publicised to students taking the module. </li><li>In th'
         b'e event that any threshold set is not reached, the results for the c'
         b"omponent will be 'incomplete' regardless of the mark obtained. Other"
         b"wise, the threshold criteria are met and the candidate is declared '"
         b"complete' on the component.</li><li>If the coursework component repr"
         b'esents less than 20% of the overall module assessment, no coursework'
         b' completion criteria need be set by the department.</li><li>If no co'
         b'ursework threshold criteria are set then the mark obtained by the ca'
         b'ndidate, including zero, is returned for the component and the overa'
         b"ll mark calculated in the usual way and the candidate declared 'comp"
         b"lete' on the component.</li></ul><p>Unseen Examinations:</p><ul><li>"
         b'An unseen examination component is only deemed complete if a candida'
         b'te has submitted an answer that can be academically assessed. The ma'
         b'rk awarded, however, might be zero. If the candidate makes little or'
         b" no attempt at the examination this will be deemed 'incomplete' and "

         b'ork, it is up to the examiners to decide whether all items must be c'

         b'm several different sources, if not clearly identified as  such, con'
         b'stitutes plagiarism just as much as does a single  unacknowledged lo'

         b'r themselves liable for an academic penalty.</li><li>Use of unacknow'

         b'ersonal Tutor or another  appropriate teacher.</li><li>Failure to ob'
         b'serve any of the provisions of this policy or of approved department'
         b'al guidelines constitutes an examination offence  under UCL and Univ'
         b'ersity Regulations. Examination offences will normally be treated as'
         b' cheating or irregularities under the Regulations in  respect of Exa'
         b'mination Irregularities. Under these Regulations students  found to '
         b'have committed an offence may be excluded from all further  examinat'
         b'ions of UCL or the University or of both.</li><li>The expression of '
         b'original ideas is considered  intellectual property, and is protecte'
         b'd by copyright laws, just like  original inventions. Almost all form'
         b's of expression fall under copyright protection as long as they are '
         b'recorded in some way (such as a book or a computer file).</li></ul><'
         b'p><b>Please take this&nbsp;information very seriously.</b> There hav'
         b'e been cases in the past in which students have been found to have c'
         b'heated by copying the work of other students and submitting this as '
         b'their own. UCL takes an extremely serious view of plagiarism. Studen'
         b'ts found to have been cheating may be given a mark of 0% for the wor'
         b"k in question. In severe cases all of a student's results for the ye"
         b'ar can be declared void and he/she can be sent down for a year. Pers'
         b'istent offenders may be permanently excluded from UCL. Note that, wh'
         b'en plagiarism is discovered, it is not normally obvious which piece '
         b'of work is the original from which the others have been copied. This'
         b' means that all those involved, including one possibly innocent part'
         b'y, come under suspicion. \r</p>\n<p>Computer Science students are '
         b'perhaps especially vulnerable since much of the material they deal w'
         b'ith is electronic and hence easy to copy. For example, if you find i'
         b'nformation or software on the&nbsp;internet which helps you with a p'
         b'iece of coursework you <b>must</b> acknowledge your source. The ackn'
         b'owledgement must be precise indicating exactly what was the source a'
         b'nd which sections of your work are affected. If it turns out that an'
         b' almost complete solution to a problem is available on the internet,'
         b' you should report that fact - it is then a problem for the lecturer'
         b" rather than for you! You should avoid looking at other students' so"
         b'lutions or allowing others to look at yours; once you have see someo'
         b"ne else's solution it is virtually impossible for you to erase it fr"
         b'om your memory and produce your own independent work. \r</p>\n<p>N'
         b'ote that we do not wish to discourage students from discussing their'
         b' work with fellow students and collaborating in solving problems. Ho'
         b'wever you should avoid allowing the collaborative phase to approach '
         b'too close to a final solution which might make it impossible for you'
         b' to make your own distinctive intellectual contribution. The key poi'
         b"nt is that you must not present the results of another person's work"
         b' &quot;as though they were your own&quot;. <b>If you feel that a sub'
         b'stantial part of a piece of work you submit for assessment has resul'
