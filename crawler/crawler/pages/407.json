For any scene, a number of different valid BSP trees can be generated, by choosing the polygons to form the partitions in a different order. In the figure below assume that line segments represent polygons (seen from above, edge-on), with the arrows indicating the front of each polygon. Give the two trees created by selecting the polygons in this order: \n<br>\nfor T1: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n<br>\nfor T2: 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\n<br>\nWhich of the two should be preferred for rendering and why?\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<img src="chap11-1.gif" alt=" " >\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\n2. Traverse each of the two trees built in Q1 and get the\nback-to-front order from the eye position e. Verify that each tree\ngives the correct order. \n\n\n    <hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_12.htm">Chapter 12</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Sun Jul 20 20:48:03 BST 2003\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
