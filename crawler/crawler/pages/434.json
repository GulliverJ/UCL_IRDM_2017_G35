Suppose we have a unit sphere centered at the origin, x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>\n= 1. There is a light source at (a,b,c). Generate a formula for\nfinding the color at any point (x,y,z) on the surface of the sphere,\nassuming that there is diffuse reflection. Define any additional terms\nyou introduce.\n\n<p>\n\n2. Assuming monochromatic light, compute the intensity of pixel p in the figure below. Doted lines labelled n are the normals to the surfaces. \n\nIntensity of light L = 1.0, Intensity of ambient colour  = 0.3, Background colour = 0.4\n\nMaterial of surface a:\n<ul>\n\t<li>ka = 0.2\n\t<li>kd = 0.2\n\t<li>kr = ks = 0.3\n\t<li>kt = 0.3\n\t<li>m (shininess) = 2\n</ul>\nMaterial of surfaces b, c and d: \n<ul>\n\t\t<li>ka = 0.2\n\t\t<li>kd = 0.3\n\t\t<li>kr = ks = 0.5\n\t\t<li>kt = 0 (surfaces are opaque)\n</ul>\n\nAlso cos(15) = 0.96, cos(30) = 0.87, cos(35) = 0.82, cos(45) = 0.71, cos(60) = 0.5.\n\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<img src="chap6-1.gif" alt=" " >\n</center>\n\n<p>\n\n\n3. The diagram below shows a 2D analog of part of a ray traced scene. There are six "surfaces" A,B,C,D,E,F and a number of rays are shown. Based on the behaviour of the rays at the surfaces, identify the kind of reflective property which each surface has.\t\n\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<img src="chap6-2.gif" alt=" " >\n</center>\n\n    <hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_6.htm">Chapter 6</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Tue Oct 02 09:33:17 GMT Daylight Time 2001\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
