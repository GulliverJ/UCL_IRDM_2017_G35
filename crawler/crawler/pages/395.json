Check that all the line equation representations given can all be expressed\n\n\nin terms of each other.<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n2. Let (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) be an arbitrary line. Let (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax)\n\n\nrepresent the boundary of a clipping box. Write out in full the Cohen-Sutherland\n\n\nclipping algorithm. Pay particular attention to the following:<br>\n\n\n(a) What are the consequences of the boundary itself being taken as "inside"\n\n\nthe clipping region or "outside"?<br>\n\n\n(b) What happens when the line is - vertical, horizontal, coincident with\n\n\na clipping boundary, a single point?<br>\n\n\n(c) Consider the case where one end-point of the line is in the region {Left},\n\n\nand the other is in the region {Bottom} and the line is outside the clipping\n\n\nregion. At what stage would such a line be "rejected"?<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n3. Repeat question 3. for the Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm.<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n4. Discuss the time complexity of CS compared to LB.<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n5. Construct Bresenham\'s algorithm for all possible cases, rather than only\n\n\nfor the set of restrictions discussed.<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n6. Give a different interpretation to Figure 17.8&nbsp; - suppose that the\n\n\ncentreof the pixel is at the centre of the box. Find the area of the box\n\n\nwhichis under the given line. Compare this quantity to the value of ei.<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n7. Suppose an image is represented by a square two dimensional array of colour\n\n\nvalues. We wish to display this image rotated by an arbitrary angle (eg,30\n\n\ndegrees). How could the line drawing algorithm of Bresenham be used toaccomplish\n\n\nthis?<br>\n\n\n    <hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_17.htm">Chapter 17</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Tue Oct 02 22:43:16 GMT Daylight Time 2001\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
