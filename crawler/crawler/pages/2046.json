{'html': b'First a few round rules on the basis of which I would be happy to su'
         b'pervise a project, relating to project management, openness, tooling'
         b' and quality assurance.\r\n\r\n* I prefer supervising projects execu'
         b'ted in the Python language using the petlib cryptographic libraries,'
         b' or other libraries I maintain (see my and the InfoSec github reposi'
         b'tories.)\r\n\r\n* I prefer supervising project that will from the ve'
         b'ry start manage the codebase on an open public github repository. Th'
         b'e project writeup may be on a private repository, but I prefer to su'
         b'pervise project that will make the final project document available '
         b'to all. In all cases all project files must be in a git repository t'
         b'hat I may access at all times.\r\n\r\n* I prefer supervising project'
         b's that will produce open source code under a free license, preferabl'
         b'y BSD, Apache or MIT. Similarly, I prefer if the final project docum'
         b'ent is made available under an open CC license.\r\n\r\n* If you wish'
         b' to do a project with me you must produce unit tests with good cover'
         b'age for the entire code base, and bring to our meetings evidence of '
         b'the passing tests and coverage. My prefered framework for doing this'
         b' in Python is using pytest and tox. \r\n\r\n* In case of a distribut'
         b"ed system's based project, you should be ready to script the deploym"
         b'ent onto a real distributed set of VMs (on EC2) using appropriate de'
         b'vops techniques. My prefered method for this is using fabric or ansi'
         b'ble.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are a few Final Year or MSc project ideas, th'
         b'at I would like to supervise (Updated for 2016/2017).\r\n\r\n* We re'
         b'cently proposed UnlimitID a way to make selective disclosure credent'
         b'ials interoperate with OAuth. The project aims will be to build a wo'
         b'rking identity system that accepts OAuth claims from providers (Goog'
         b'le, Facebook), then uses UnlimitID to anonymiz them, and then issue '
         b'fresh OAuth claims for use in other sites. For more information see:'

         b'selective disclosure credentials. Traditional selective disclosure c'
         b'redentials depend on a single authority issuing them. However, such '
         b'an authority needs to be trusted to not issue false credentials. The'
         b' idea of this project is to modify the aMACs based credentials by Ch'
         b'ase et al. to require multiple authorities to cooperate to issue a c'
         b'redential, under the assumption that a single honest authority would'
         b' prevent false claims from being issued:\r\n\r\nMelissa Chase, Sarah'

         b" network's message content is easy with cryptography, but hiding who"
         b' is talking to whom is harder. This project will implement a state-o'
         b'f-the-art mix-system that allows the transmission of untraceable mes'
         b'sages based on the Sphinx mix design by Danezis & Goldberg (2009'
         b').\r\n\r\n\r\nOld project ideas, done or now boring:\r\n\r\n* A pe'
         b'er-to-peer public key infrastructure. The reason we do not use encry'
         b'ption for most communications is the lack of a free, easy to use and'
         b' integrate, public key infrastructure. The aim of this project is to'
         b' build a simple service that allows users to register verification k'
         b'eys, and applications to use them to authenticate users and encrypt '
         b'messages to them. The twist: no single server should be able to impe'
         b'rsonate a user!\r\n\r\n* Privacy-friendly age verification, or other'
         b' attributes. There are noises in government that some form of age ve'
         b'rification may become mandatory to access some types of content onli'
         b'ne. The objective of this project is to implement a simple anonymous'
         b' credential based age verification mechanism, that proves a user is '
         b'over 18, but otherwise leaks nothing else about the identity of the '
         b'user (not even that they are the same user as before). This combines'
         b' techniques from attribute based credentials (crypto) and networking'
         b'. \r\n\r\n* Anonymous e-cash. Credit card transactions tell your ban'
         b'k everything you buy, and tell the merchant who you are. Would it no'
         b't be nice if we could have an electronic equivalent of physical cash'
         b'? In particular, it could be used to pay small amount to web sites y'
         b'ou visit and also do away with the need for annoying online ads. The'
         b' project implements such a system, based on a simple scheme by Baldi'
         b'mtsi & Lysyanskaya (2013).\r\n\r\n* Meiklejon and myself (Danezis) h'
         b'ave proposed a centralized cryptographic currency. It is very scalab'
         b'le, and allows used to audit what the central bank and others in the'
         b' system are doing, thus democratizing finance. The objective of this'
         b' project is to implement the full logging sub-system that enables au'
         b'ditability, measure its performance and show that it fulfills its pr'
         b'omises. The full paper describing the system is at: https://eprint.i'

         b'e app and chat. Would it not be nice if you could chat, and exchange'
         b' pictures, movies and files privately with all those you have met in'
         b' the past? The aim of this project is to build a usable and secure w'
         b'ay for two people to use their phones to exchange key material and s'
         b'ubsequently have a private chat.\r\n\r\n* Encrypted group chat. A nu'
         b'mber of good solutions exist for one-on-one private instant messagin'
         b'g (IM), but few that allow groups to talk in private over IM. The ai'
         b'm of this project is to implement one!\r\n\r\n* Service for computat'
         b'ions on private genetic data. Genetic tests are increasingly importa'
         b'nt in medicine, but would you trust your full genome being stored in'
         b' the cloud? The aim of this project is the implementation of a priva'
         b'cy-friendly computation of genetic tests based on a simple protocol '

         b'vesdropper know you are using encryption. In those cases you may wis'
         b'h to use "steganography", the art of hiding secret messages into inn'
         b'ocuous media such as pictures of kittens. The objective of this proj'
