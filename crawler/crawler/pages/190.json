This course describes recent work in both the graphics and\n  vision communities to measure the spatially- and\n  directionally-varying reflectance and subsurface scattering of\n  complex materials, and to develop efficient representations and\n  analysis tools for these datasets.  We describe the design of\n  acquisition devices and capture strategies for BRDFs and BSSRDFs,\n  efficient factored representations, and a case study of capturing\n  the appearance of human faces.</p>\n\n<h2>Duration</h2>\n\n<p>\n      3-4 hours\n</p>\n\n<h2>Course Outline</h2>\n\n<ol type=I>\n<li>A Review of Radiometry & Physical Models (<i>Rusinkiewicz</i>)\n  <ul>\n    <li>Radiometry</li>\n    <li>Surface Reflectance</li>\n    <li>Subsurface Scattering</li>\n    <li>Generalizing Reflectance and Scattering</li>\n  </ul></li>\n<li>\n  Principles of Acquisition (<i>Zickler</i>)\n  <ul>\n    <li>Homogeneous Reflectance: BRDF\n      <ul>\n        <li>The Gonioreflectometer</li>\n        <li>Image-based acquisition</li>\n      </ul></li>\n    <li>Spatially-varying Reflectance: SVBRDF</li>\n    <li>Subsurface scattering: BSSRDF</li>\n    <li>Calibration</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n  (Spatially Varying) BRDF Models (<i>Lawrence</i>)\n  <ul>\n    <li>Acquisition</li>\n    <li>Representation\n\t    <ul><li>Basis Decomposition</li>\n\t      <li>Parametric Models</li>\n\t      </ul>\n\t  </li>\n    <li>The Inverse Shade Tree Framework</li>\n    <li>Directions of Future Research</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n  From BSSRDFs to 8D Reflectance Fields (<i>Lensch</i>)\n  <ul>\n    <li>BTFs and Distant Light Reflectance Fields</li>\n    <li>BSSRDFs</li>\n    <li>Diffuse Subsurface Scattering</li>\n    <li>Arbitrary Light Transport</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n  The Human Face Scanner Project (<i>Weyrich</i>)\n  <ul>\n    <li>Skin Appearance Acquisition</li>\n    <li>Face Data Processing</li>\n    <li>Reflectance Model Fit</li>\n    <li>Reflectance Analysis</li>\n    <li>Appearance Transfer</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n  Future Directions of Research / Q&A\n  <ul>\n    <li>Time-varying appearance properties</li>\n    <li>Multi-spectral acquisition</li>\n    <li>Combined shape and material acquisition</li>\n  </ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</p>\n\n<h2>Short Biographies</h2>\n\n<p>\n<b>Jason Lawrence</b>\n    is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science\n    Department at the University of Virginia.  He holds a Ph.D. in\n    computer science from Princeton University.  Jason\'s principal\n    research interests focus on the acquisition and efficient\n    representation of real-world material appearance.  He recently\n    introduced an "Inverse Shade Trees" framework for representing\n    measured surface reflectance through a hierarchical decomposition\n    designed for efficient rendering and editing.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Hendrik P. A. Lensch</b>\n    is the head of an independent research group\n    "General Appearance Acquisition and Computational Photography" at\n    the MPI Informatik in Saarbruecken, Germany.  The group is part of\n    the Max Planck Center for Visual Computing and Communication\n    (Saarbruecken / Stanford).  He received his diploma in computers\n    science from the University of Erlangen in 1999.  He worked as a\n    research associate at Hans-Peter Seidel\'s computer graphics group\n    at the MPI Informatik in Saarbruecken and received his PhD from\n    Saarland University in 2003.  He spent two years (2005-2006) as a\n    visiting assistant professor at Stanford University, USA.  His\n    research interests include 3D appearance acquisition, image-based\n    and computational photography rendering.  He has given several\n    lectures and tutorials about this topic at various conferences\n    including SIGGRAPH courses on realistic materials in 2002 and\n    2005.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Szymon Rusinkiewicz</b>\n    is an associate professor of Computer Science\n    at Princeton University.  His work focuses on acquisition and\n    analysis of the 3D shape and appearance of real-world objects,\n    including the design of capture devices and data structures for\n    efficient representation.  He also investigates algorithms for\n    processing complex datasets of shape and reflectance, including\n    registration, matching, completion, symmetry analysis, and\n    sampling.  In addition to data acquisition, his research interests\n    include real-time rendering and perceptually-guided depiction.  He\n    obtained his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2001.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Tim Weyrich</b> is a Post-doctoral Teaching Fellow at Princeton\n    University, working in the Computer Graphics Group Princeton.  His\n    research interests are point-based graphics, 3D reconstruction, and\n    appearance modeling.  Prior to coming to Princeton in Fall 2006, he\n    received his PhD from ETH Zurich, Switzerland, where he developed a\n    novel face scanner to analyze human skin reflectance, allowing for\n    photo-realistic reconstructions of human faces.  He received his\n    Diploma degree in computer science from the University of Karlsruhe\n    (TU), Germany, in 2001.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>Todd Zickler</b>\n    received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Yale University\n    in 2004 and is currently an assistant professor in the School of\n    Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University. His\n    research spans computer vision, computer graphics and image\n    processing, and he is currently focused on developing\n    representations of appearance and exploiting them for visual\n    inference. In 2006, he was the recipient of a career award from\n    the US NSF titled, "Foundations for Ubiquitous Image-based\n    Appearance Capture."\n</p>\n\n\n<h2>Course Notes</h2>\nDownload <a href="./iccv07-appearance-course.pdf">course notes (1.3 MB)</a> and <a href="./iccv07-appearance-slides.pdf">slides (33 MB)</a>...\n\n<!--\n<ol>\n<li> <a href="iccv05_intro.pdf">Introduction</a> <a href="iccv05_intro.ppt">[.ppt]</a>\n<li> <a href="bibliography.pdf">Annotated Bibliography: Published\nResearch on Shape Matching and Alignment</a>\n<li> <a href="iccv05_matching.pdf">Shape Matching for Model\nAlignment</a> <a href="iccv05_matching.ppt">[.ppt]</a>\n<li> <a href="iccv05_icp_gr.pdf">Rigid-Body Alignment</a> <a href="iccv05_icp_gr.ppt">[.ppt]</a>\n<li> <a href="iccv05_nonrigid.pdf">Non-Rigid Alignment</a>\n</ol>\n</ul>\n\n-->\n\n</body>\n</html>\n',
