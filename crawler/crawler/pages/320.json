Digital Landscapes create a common \r    territory between the two remote cities, contracting and expanding the space \r    between. The proposal is the construction of a digital space of remote dimensions \r    existing between the split realities of Lake Zurich and the Serpentine.</p>\r  <p><img src="images/digitallandscapes2.jpg" width="450" height="285"></p>\r  <p><em>Digital Landscapes</em> is an interactive installation for multiple participants \r    distributed across multiple sites in the two cities. The installations allow \r    participants to collaborate in the construction of a shared environment experienced \r    through the composite image. Digital Landscapes creates a shared territory \r    between the sites of Lake Zurich and the Serpentine. The shared territory \r    is an internal landscape scaled and re-constructed through the superpositioning \r    of the views. This scaling and re-construction explodes the transparency of \r    the overlay ending the linearity of simple superposition. The territories \r    are mapped on to each other constructing a simultaneous sense of continuity \r    and fragmentation <em>Digital Landscapes</em> is a territory where distance \r    and place take on new meaning. Rather than understanding distance through \r    scale, distance becomes a possibility of creating a new territory between \r    the remote and the present. Place is that which is open for the intrusion \r    of the remote &#916; that which allows intervention and re-composition.</p>\r  <p>Digital Landscapes was exhibited at the Danish Architecture Centre, 2001.</p>\r  <p>&nbsp;</p>\r  </div>\r</body>\r</html>\r',
