Design a simple scene consisting of a room with six walls, containing\n\n\ntwo desks (which should be identically constructed) and on each of the desks\n\n\nshould be a pile of books. Ideally there should be a door into the room and\n\n\na couple of windows.<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n2. Write the function setCTM() to enable an application program to directly\n\n\nset the Current Transformation Matrix.<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n3.There are three boxes A, B and C. A and B are next to each other, and C\n\n\nrests on both A and B. If either A or B is moved then this should affect\n\n\nC. How would you model this situation?<br>\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n4. Construct a hierarchy for a simple human figure.<br>\n\n<br>\n\n5. Find the plane equation of the polygon (P) which has vertices (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,1), (0,1,1). The order of points is given so that when looking at the front of the polygon, the points are in anti-clockwise order.\n\n<p>\n\n6(a).  For edges 0 and 4 indicate the Next Vertex, Previous Vertex, Next\nFace and Previous Face for the Winged Edge data structure.  \n\n<center>\n<img src="chap8-1.gif" alt=" " >\n</center>\n\n<ul>\n<li>v0 v1 v4 = Face0\n<li>v5 v3 v2 = Face1\n<li>v1 v2 v3 v4 = Face2\n<li>v0 v4 v3 v5 = Face3\n<li>v0 v5 v2 v1 = Face4\n<li>edge0= v0 v1\n<li>edge1 = v1 v2\n<li>edge2 = v2 v5\n<li>edge3 = v5 v0\n<li>edge4 = v1 v4\n<li>edge5 = v2 v3\n<li>edge6 = v5 v3\n<li>edge7 = v0 v4\n</ul>\n\n6(b). Explain how the winged edge data structure would be completed - that is how the wings would be found. Give an example using edges 0 and 4.\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n\n<font SIZE="-2">\n\nBack to: <a href="../../exercises.htm">Index of Exercises</a><br>\nBack to: <a href="../../chapter_8.htm">Chapter 8</a>\n\n</font>\n\n    <hr>\n<!-- Created: Tue Oct 02 09:16:49 GMT Daylight Time 2001 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: Tue Oct 02 22:42:34 GMT Daylight Time 2001\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n  </body>\n</html>\n',
